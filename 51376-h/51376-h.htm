<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this
desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds with
which the Military History of our country abounds. To hold
forth these bright examples to the imitation of the youthful
soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their honourable
career, are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the 'London Gazette,' from whence they are transferred
into the public prints: the achievements of our armies are thus
made known at the time of their occurrence, and receive the
tribute of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament have
been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders, and the
Officers and Troops acting under their orders, expressions of
approbation and of thanks for their skill and bravery, and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
Approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier most
highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular records of their
services and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been
experienced in obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments,
an authentic account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its services at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations
which chequer the career of those who embrace the military
profession. In Great Britain, where so large a number of
persons are devoted to the active concerns of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, and where these pursuits have,
for so long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of war</em>,
which few other countries have escaped, comparatively little
is known of the vicissitudes of active service, and of the
casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the British
Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little or
no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed
not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and
the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties;
and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they have effected
debarkations in spite of the most formidable opposition, and
by the gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions
of the Corps employed; but the details of their services, and
of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully given in the
Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting to
military men of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general reader,
particularly to those who may have served in the Army, or
who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served,
or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment
to every thing belonging to their Regiment; to such
persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot
fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions
of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always been of
paramount interest with a brave and civilised people. Great
Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments of
danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks of their
native shore;" and when half the World has been arrayed
against them, they have fought the battles of their Country
with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers&mdash;our fellow-citizens
in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory of the brave,
and brings their gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove
acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from
time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be faithfully
set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up in
numerical succession.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The ancient Armies of England were composed
of Horse and Foot; but the feudal troops established
by William the Conqueror in 1086, consisted
almost entirely of Horse. Under the feudal
system, every holder of land amounting to what
was termed a "knight's fee," was required to
provide a charger, a coat of mail, a helmet, a
shield, and a lance, and to serve the Crown a
period of forty days in each year at his own
expense; and the great landholders had to provide
armed men in proportion to the extent of
their estates; consequently the ranks of the feudal
Cavalry were completed with men of property,
and the vassals and tenants of the great barons,
who led their dependents to the field in person.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reigns the Cavalry of the
Army was composed of Knights (or men at arms)
and Hobiliers (or horsemen of inferior degree);
and the Infantry of spear and battle-axe men,
cross-bowmen, and archers. The Knights wore
armour on every part of the body, and their
weapons were a lance, a sword, and a small
dagger. The Hobiliers were accoutred and armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
for the light and less important services of war,
and were not considered qualified for a charge in
line. Mounted Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were also introduced,
and the English nation eventually became pre-eminent
in the use of the bow.</p>

<p>About the time of Queen Mary the appellation
of "<em>Men at Arms</em>" was changed to that of "<em>Spears</em>
and <em>Launces</em>." The introduction of fire-arms ultimately
occasioned the lance to fall into disuse,
and the title of the Horsemen of the first degree
was changed to "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cuirassiers</i>." The Cuirassiers
were armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pié</i>, and their weapons were a
sword with a straight narrow blade and sharp
point, and a pair of large pistols, called petrenels;
and the Hobiliers carried carbines. The Infantry
carried pikes, matchlocks, and swords. The
introduction of fire-arms occasioned the formation
of regiments armed and equipped as infantry,
but mounted on small horses for the sake of
expedition of movement, and these were styled
"<em>Dragoons</em>;" a small portion of the military
force of the kingdom, however, consisted of this
description of troops.</p>

<p>The formation of the present Army commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>after the Restoration in 1660, with the establishment
of regular corps of Horse and Foot; the
Horsemen were cuirassiers, but only wore armour
on the head and body; and the Foot were pikemen
and musketeers. The arms which each
description of force carried, are described in the
following extract from the "Regulations of King
Charles II.," dated 5th May, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Each Horseman to have for his defensive
armes, back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive
armes, a sword, and a case of pistolls, the
barrels whereof are not to be und<sup>r</sup>. foorteen
inches in length; and each Trooper of Our
Guards to have a carbine, besides the aforesaid
armes. And the Foote to have each souldier a
sword, and each pikeman a pike of 16 foote
long and not und<sup>r</sup>.; and each musqueteer a
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, the barrels

<p>The ranks of the Troops of Horse were at this
period composed of men of some property&mdash;generally
the sons of substantial yeomen: the young
men received as recruits provided their own horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>and they were placed on a rate of pay sufficient
to give them a respectable station in society.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland,
in the spring of 1672, a Regiment of Dragoons
was raised<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Dragoons were placed on a lower
rate of pay than the Horse; and the Regiment
was armed similar to the Infantry, excepting that
a limited number of the men carried halberds
instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets;
and a few men in each Troop had pistols;
as appears by a warrant dated the 2nd of April,
1672, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p class="in2">"Our will and pleasure is, that a Regiment
of Dragoones which we have established
and ordered to be raised, in twelve Troopes of
fourscore in each beside officers, who are to be
under the command of Our most deare and most
intirely beloved Cousin Prince Rupert, shall
be armed out of Our stoares remaining within
Our office of the Ordinance, as followeth; that
is to say, three corporalls, two serjeants, the
gentlemen at armes, and twelve souldiers of
each of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and
carry each of them one halbard, and one case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>of pistolls with holsters; and the rest of the
souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are
to have and to carry each of them one matchlocke
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and
also to have and to carry one bayonet<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, or great
knife. That each lieutenant have and carry
one partizan; and that two drums be delivered
out for each Troope of the said Regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p></div>

<p>Several regiments of Horse and Dragoons were
raised in the first year of the reign of King
James II.; and the horsemen carried a short carbine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in addition to the sword and pair of pistols:
and in a Regulation dated the 21st of February,
1687, the arms of the Dragoons at that period are
commanded to be as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Dragoons to have snaphanse musquets,
strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouch-boxes, bayonetts, granado
pouches, bucketts, and hammer-hatchetts."</p>
</div>

<p>After several years' experience, little advantage
was found to accrue from having Cavalry Regiments
formed almost exclusively for engaging the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>enemy on foot; and, the Horse having laid aside
their armour, the arms and equipment of Horse
and Dragoons were so nearly assimilated, that
there remained little distinction besides the name
and rate of pay. The introduction of improvements
into the mounting, arming, and equipment
of Dragoons rendered them competent to the
performance of every description of service required
of Cavalry; and, while the long musket
and bayonet were retained, to enable them to act
as Infantry, if necessary, they were found to be
equally efficient, and of equal value to the nation,
as Cavalry, with the Regiments of Horse.</p>

<p>In the several augmentations made to the
regular Army after the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, no new Regiments of Horse were
raised for permanent service; and in 1746 King
George II. reduced three of the old Regiments
of Horse to the quality and pay of Dragoons; at
the same time, His Majesty gave them the title of
First, Second, and Third Regiments of <em>Dragoon
Guards</em>: and in 1788 the same alteration was
made in the remaining four Regiments of Horse,
which then became the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Regiments of <em>Dragoon Guards</em>.</p>

<p>At present there are only three Regiments
which are styled <em>Horse</em> in the British Army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
namely, the two Regiments of Life Guards, and
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, to whom
cuirasses have recently been restored. The other
Cavalry Regiments consist of Dragoon Guards,
Heavy and Light Dragoons, Hussars, and Lancers;
and although the long musket and bayonet have
been laid aside by the whole of the Cavalry, and
the Regiments are armed and equipped on the
principle of the old Horse (excepting the cuirass),
they continue to be styled Dragoons.</p>

<p>The old Regiments of Horse formed a highly
respectable and efficient portion of the Army,
and it is found, on perusing the histories of the
various campaigns in which they have been engaged,
that they have, on all occasions, maintained
a high character for steadiness and discipline, as
well as for bravery in action. They were formerly
mounted on horses of superior weight and physical
power, and few troops could withstand a
well-directed charge of the celebrated British
Horse. The records of these corps embrace a
period of 150 years&mdash;a period eventful in history,
and abounding in instances of heroism displayed
by the British troops when danger has threatened
the nation,&mdash;a period in which these Regiments
have numbered in their ranks men of loyalty,
valour, and good conduct, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the Regiments of Horse were formed
into Dragoon Guards, additional improvements
have been introduced into the constitution of the
several corps; and the superior description of
horses now bred in the United Kingdom enables
the commanding officers to remount their regiments
with such excellent horses, that, whilst
sufficient weight has been retained for a powerful
charge in line, a lightness has been acquired which
renders them available for every description of
service incident to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The orderly conduct of these Regiments in
quarters has gained the confidence and esteem of
the respectable inhabitants of the various parts of
the United Kingdom in which they have been
stationed; their promptitude and alacrity in attending
to the requisitions of the magistrates in
periods of excitement, and the temper, patience,
and forbearance which they have evinced when
subjected to great provocation, insult, and violence
from the misguided populace, prove the value of
these troops to the Crown, and to the Government
of the country, and justify the reliance which is
reposed on them.</p>

<p class="noindent">The Regiment, which forms the subject of the
following memoir, is one of the seventeen corps,
now in the British army, which derive their origin
from the commotions in England during the first
year of the reign of King James II.</p>

<p>The origin of these commotions may be traced
to the pernicious councils adopted by King Charles
I., which were followed by a flame of puritanical
zeal and of democratical fury and outrage in the
country, which deprived the monarch of life, and
forced the royal family to reside for several years
in exile on the continent, where King Charles II.
and his brother, James Duke of York, imbibed
the doctrines of the Church of Rome. After the
Restoration, in 1660, the King concealed his religion
from his Protestant subjects; but the Duke
of York openly avowed the tenets of the Roman
Catholic Church, which rendered him exceedingly
unpopular. King Charles II. having no legitimate
issue, his eldest illegitimate son, <span class="smcap">James Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Monmouth</span>, an officer of some merit, who had
espoused the Protestant cause with great warmth,
and had become very popular, aspired to the throne.
In a few months after the accession of James II.,
this nobleman arrived from Holland (11th June,
1685) with a band of armed followers, and erecting
his standard in the west of England, called
upon the people to aid him in gaining the sovereign
power.</p>

<p>Although a deep feeling of anxiety was general
in the kingdom at this period, yet the King had
declared his determination to support the Protestant
religion, as by law established, and his designs
against the constitution had not been manifested;
hence loyalty to the sovereign, a principle so
genial to the innate feelings of the British people,
prevailed over every other consideration. A number
of Mendip miners and other disaffected persons
joined the Duke of Monmouth; but men of all ranks
arrayed themselves under the banners of royalty.</p>

<p>To officers and soldiers imbued with a laudable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>, the particulars relating to the
origin and services of their regiment are of intense
interest, and the circumstances which gave rise to
the formation of their corps are of themselves an
era. To encourage such feelings is one of the
objects of the present undertaking, and, although
the general reader may think the narrative tedious,
the officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon
Guards</span> will feel gratified at learning by whom,
and where, each troop, of which their regiment
was originally composed, was raised. This information
has been procured from public documents,
in which it is recorded that, in the midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hostile preparations which the Duke of Monmouth's
rebellion occasioned in every part of the
kingdom, a troop of horse was raised by <span class="smcap">James
Earl of Arran</span>, eldest son of William Duke
of Hamilton, a nobleman distinguished alike for
loyalty and attachment to the Protestant religion;
a second troop was raised, in the vicinity of London,
by Captain John Parker, Lieutenant of the
Horse Grenadier Guards attached to the King's
Own troop of Life Guards (now First Regiment
of Life Guards); a third at Lichfield, by William
Baggott, Esq.; a fourth at Grantham, by Thomas
Harrington, Esq.; a fifth at Durham, by John
Fetherstonhalgh, Esq.; and the sixth at Morpeth,
by William Ogle, Esq.; and that, after the decisive
battle of Sedgemoor had destroyed the hopes of
the invader, these six troops were ordered to march
to the south of England, and were incorporated
into a regiment of <span class="smcap">Cuirassiers</span>, which is now
the <span class="smcap">Fourth or Royal Irish Regiment of
Dragoon Guards</span>. The Colonelcy was conferred
on the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran</span>, by commission,
dated the 28th of July, 1685; the Lieutenant-Colonelcy
on Captain Charles Nedby,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Queen's regiment of horse; and the commission
of Major on Captain John Parker.</p>

<p>At the formation of this regiment it ranked as
<span class="smcap">Sixth Horse</span>, but was distinguished by the name
of its Colonel, the practice of using numerical
titles not having been introduced into the British
army until the reign of King George II. This
corps being composed of the sons of substantial
yeomen and tradesmen, who provided their own
horses, it was held in high estimation in the
country, and the men were placed on a rate of
pay (2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> per day) which gave them a respectable
station in society. Few nations in Europe
possessed a body of troops which could vie with
the English horse in all the qualities of good
soldiers, and, in the reigns of King William III.
and Queen Anne, this <em>arme</em> acquired a celebrity
for gallantry and good conduct; and these qualities,
whether evinced by bravery in the field,
or by steadiness and temperate behaviour when
their services have been required on home duties,
have proved their usefulness, and have rendered
them valuable corps during succeeding reigns.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran's</span> Regiment was armed
and equipped, in common with the other regiments
of <span class="smcap">Cuirassiers</span>, with long swords, a pair
of long pistols, and short carbines; the men
wore hats, with broad brims bound with narrow
lace, turned up on one side, and ornamented
with ribands; large boots; and gauntlet gloves;
their defensive armour was steel cuirasses, and
head-pieces. This regiment was distinguished
by white ribands, white linings to the coat, white
waistcoats and breeches, white horse-furniture, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
carbine belts covered with white cloth, and ornamented
with lace, and the officers wore white
silk sashes;&mdash;each regiment had a distinguishing
colour, which was then called its <em>livery</em>, and which
is now called <em>facing</em>, and the distinguishing colour
of the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran's</span> Regiment was
<span class="fs70">WHITE</span>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>On their arrival in the south of England,
<span class="smcap">Arran's Cuirassiers</span> proceeded to the vicinity
of Hounslow, and on the 20th of August passed in
review before King James II. and his court on
the heath. In order to make a display of his
power and to overawe the disaffected in the kingdom,
His Majesty ordered an army of eight thousand
men to encamp on Hounslow Heath, of which
this regiment formed a part; and on the 22nd of
August the King reviewed twenty squadrons of
horse, one of horse-grenadier guards, one of dragoons,
and ten battalions of foot on the heath.
After the review <span class="smcap">Arran's Cuirassiers</span> marched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>into quarters at Winchester and Andover, where
they arrived on the 5th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>In these quarters the regiment passed the succeeding
winter; and on the 1st of January, 1686,
its establishment was fixed by a warrant under
the sign manual, from which the following is an
extract:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arran's Cuirassiers</span> were called from their
cantonments in Hampshire in June, and again
pitched their tents on Hounslow Heath, where they
were reviewed several times by the King; and
afterwards marched into quarters at Leicester,
Ashby de la Zouch, Loughborough, and Melton
Mowbray; and while in these quarters their Lieutenant-Colonel
retired, and was succeeded by Major
John Parker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1687</div>

<p>In the following summer they were withdrawn
from Leicestershire, and proceeding to the metropolis,
occupied quarters for a short time at Chelsea
and Knightsbridge, from whence they proceeded
to Hounslow, and again pitched their tents on the
heath. After having been reviewed by the King,
they marched (9th August) to Windsor and adjacent
villages, and furnished a guard for the royal
family at Windsor Castle; also a guard for the
Princess Anne (afterwards Queen Anne) at Hampton
Court Palace, and one troop was stationed at
London to assist the Life Guards in their attendance
on the Court.</p>

<p>On the 31st of August the regiment marched
to London, and was quartered in Holborn, Gray's
Inn Lane, and the vicinity of Smithfield, in order to
take part in the duties of the court and metropolis;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and in September it furnished a detachment to protect
a large sum of money from London to Portsmouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>Having been relieved from the King's duty,
<span class="smcap">Arran's Cuirassiers</span> marched to Richmond and
adjacent villages in May, 1688; and in July they
once more encamped on Hounslow Heath. After
taking part in several reviews, mock-battles, and
splendid military spectacles, which were exhibited
on the Heath by a numerous army, they proceeded
to Cambridge, Peterborough, and St. Ives, and
afterwards to Ipswich, where they were stationed
a short time under Major-General Sir John Lanier,
but were suddenly ordered to march to London in
the beginning of November.</p>

<p>The circumstances in which the loyal officers
and soldiers of the King's army were placed were
of a most painful character. The King had been
making rapid advances towards the subversion of
the established religion and laws of the kingdom;
and loyalty to the sovereign,&mdash;a distinguished
feature in the character of the British soldier, and
the love of the best interests of their native country,&mdash;which
is inherent in men, were become so opposed
to each other, that it appeared necessary for
one to be sacrificed. <span class="smcap">Arran's Cuirassiers</span> were,
however, spared this painful ordeal by the circumstances
which occurred. The King had resolved
to remodel his army in England by the dismissal
of Protestants and the introduction of Papists, as
he had already done in Ireland; but the arrival of
the Prince of Orange, with a Dutch army to aid
the English nobility in opposing the proceedings
of the Court, overturned the King's measures.
The loyalty and attachment to the King evinced
by the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran</span> occasioned him to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General, and his
regiment was considered one of the corps on which
dependence could be placed. It had completed an
augmentation of ten men per troop ordered in
September, and was selected to remain as a guard
near the Queen and the infant Prince of Wales,
who was afterwards known as the Pretender: but
a defection appearing in the army, the infant
Prince was sent to Portsmouth; and the regiment,
having been released from its duty of attendance
on the Queen, was ordered to march to Salisbury.</p>

<p>Many officers and soldiers joined the Prince of
Orange, and amongst others, Lord Churchill,
Colonel of the third troop of Life Guards; the
King gave the Duke of Berwick the command of
the third troop of Life Guards; removed the <span class="smcap">Earl
of Arran</span> to the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards;
and conferred the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Sixth Horse</span>
on the Earl's brother, <span class="smcap">Charles Earl of Selkirk</span>,
from Guidon and Major in the fourth troop of Life
Guards, his commission bearing date the 20th of
November, 1688.</p>

<p>The desertions which took place alarmed the
King and Queen; Her Majesty fled with the infant
Prince to France, and was followed by the King.
The Prince of Orange assumed the reins of government,
and the <span class="smcap">Earl of Selkirk's</span> regiment was
ordered to march to Stamford in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December, 1688, the Prince of
Orange conferred the Colonelcy of the regiment
on Colonel Charles Godfrey, who had previously
held a commission in the Duke of Monmouth's
regiment of horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>The Prince and Princess of Orange having
ascended the throne while the regiment was quartered
in Lincolnshire, it took part in the solemnity
of the proclamation of their Majesty's accession at
Stamford, on the 16th of February, 1689, on which
occasion three troops, with the trumpets and kettle
drums, paraded the town, and, 'after firing several
volleys, partook of a substantial repast, with abundance
of wine, and drank their Majesties' health
amidst reiterated acclamations.'</p>

<p>In the middle of March three troops proceeded
to the Isle of Wight, where 1500 Irish Roman
Catholics were detained in the custody of a military
force. These men had entered the service of
King James in Ireland, and had been ordered to
England to support the arbitrary proceedings of
the Court; at the Revolution they were deprived
of their arms and sent prisoners to the Isle of
Wight, from whence they were eventually transported
to Hamburgh, to be disposed of in the service
of the Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>Thirty men and horses of the regiment were
transferred, in April, to the Blues, to complete the
establishment of that corps previous to its embarkation
for Holland.</p>

<p>During the summer three troops of the <span class="smcap">Sixth
Horse</span> were encamped on Hounslow Heath. King
William had reasons to suspect that several old
corps were not well affected towards his interests;
but His Majesty appears to have placed entire confidence
in the attachment of the officers and men
of this regiment to his person and government;
and in August a strong detachment left the camp
at Hounslow, to take part in the duties of the
Court and metropolis. The remainder of the
three troops of the <span class="smcap">Sixth Horse</span>, encamped on
the heath, proceeded into quarters at Croydon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Mitcham; and in December, the three troops in
the Isle of Wight were removed to Salisbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>The detachment having been relieved from the
King's duty in London, the regiment was removed
in February, 1690, into quarters at Oxford and
Abingdon. In the following month it received
orders to embark for Ireland, to serve under King
William, against the French and the Irish Roman
Catholics under King James. This order was,
however, countermanded, and when the King proceeded
with three troops of Life Guards to Ireland,
this regiment marched into quarters in the villages
near London, in order to take part in the duties of
the Court. Having been relieved from this duty
by the Fourth Horse (now 3rd Dragoon Guards),
the regiment marched into quarters at Portsmouth
and Isle of Wight, and subsequently to Salisbury
and Winchester.</p>

<p>During the winter, the Fifth Regiment of Horse<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
was disbanded in Ireland; and the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'SIXTH Horse obtained'"><span class="smcap">Sixth Horse</span>
obtained</ins> rank as <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span> from this period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>From Salisbury and Winchester the regiment,
now taking rank as <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>, was withdrawn
in May, 1691, and proceeded to Hertford, Dartford,
and Romford, and one troop furnished the
guard at Windsor for the Queen Dowager, Catherine,
consort of the late King Charles II. In
June one troop was in attendance on the Princess
Anne at Tunbridge; and in the autumn the regiment
furnished a relay of escorts to attend the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>from Harwich to London, when His Majesty returned
from the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The conquest of Ireland having been achieved,
the King was enabled to augment his army in the
Low Countries; and, soon after His Majesty's
arrival in England, <span class="smcap">Godfrey's Horse</span> were selected
to proceed on foreign service. The regiment
was, accordingly, embarked in transports on
the river Thames on the 27th of November, and
sailed on the following day. After its arrival in
Flanders it went into quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

in Europe, against the forces of Louis XIV. of
France. After several movements, King William
attacked the French army, commanded by Marshal
Luxembourg, at its position near <em>Steenkirk</em>, on
the 24th of July, 1692. The <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span> supported
the attacking column, and when the infantry
deployed, it drew up on the right skirts of a wood,
through which the main body of the army had to
pass. The leading corps behaved with signal gallantry,
but were repulsed, and the main body of
the army was too far in the rear to give the required
support. An immense body of French
cavalry menacing the British infantry, the <span class="smcap">Fifth
Horse</span> were ordered to advance, and they succeeded
in checking the enemy's squadrons. Lord
Mountjoy<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, a young nobleman of great promise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>who was serving as a volunteer, was killed by a
cannon ball at the head of the regiment. It soon
afterwards received orders to retire, and this movement
was covered by a squadron of Horse Grenadier
Guards. The regiment was subsequently engaged
in several movements, and in the autumn it
proceeded into winter-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>Shortly after the battle of Steenkirk, the Princess
Anne of Denmark's regiment of horse,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which
had lost many men and horses in the action, was
disbanded; and on the 7th of March, 1693, its
Colonel, Francis Langston, was appointed to the
command of the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>, vice Colonel
Charles Godfrey, who retired.</p>

<p>In the ensuing campaign the regiment was again
engaged for several weeks in marches, manœuvring,
and occupying positions on the rich plains of the
Netherlands, to defeat the designs of the enemy;
and on the 19th of July it was engaged in the hard-contested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>battle of <em>Landen</em>, where it had an opportunity
of distinguishing itself. It was formed,
during the early part of the action, near the village
of Neer-Landen, to support the infantry on the left,
and sustained some loss from a heavy cannonade
to which it was exposed. At length Marshal
Luxembourg, by means of an immense superiority
of numbers, carried the village of Neer-Winden,
forced the position occupied by his opponents, and
his numerous cavalry overpowered the squadrons
in the right wing of the confederate army. King
William instantly ordered the English horse on the
left to oppose the victorious career of the enemy;
and <span class="smcap">Langston's Regiment</span>, galloping to the scene
of conflict, charged the French horsemen with
signal gallantry. The right squadron of this regiment,
led by its Colonel, <span class="smcap">Francis Langston</span>,
broke the French squadron to which it was opposed,
and made great slaughter; and the heroic
<span class="smcap">Langston</span>, an officer remarkable for prowess and
valour, who had served against the Moors in Africa,
and at the battles of the Boyne, Aghrim, and Steenkirk,
was seen using his broadsword with terrible
execution, but he was eventually surrounded, severely
wounded, and taken prisoner. Fresh squadrons
of French cavalry, flushed with the prospect
of victory, renewed the fight, and, notwithstanding
the bravery evinced by the English horse, superiority
of numbers prevailed. King William ordered
a retreat, which, having to be made across bridges
and by narrow defiles, was not executed without
much confusion and loss. His Majesty remained
on the ground until nearly surrounded by the enemy;
but he was rescued by a party of his Life
Guards and a troop of Horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>After retiring from the field, the regiment proceeded
to Tirlemont; it was subsequently engaged
in several movements, and on the 5th of August it
was reviewed by King William, with the remainder
of the cavalry, near Wemmel. In November it
marched into quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>Having been joined by a body of recruits and
remount horses from England, to replace the losses
of the preceding campaign, the regiment marched
out of Ghent in May, 1694, to cantonments in the
villages between Brussels and Dendermond. The
campaign of this year was remarkable for the long
and fatiguing marches performed by the troops;
but no general engagement occurred. After traversing
Flanders and Brabant in various directions,
and experiencing much privation from the country
having so long been the seat of war, the regiment
returned to its former quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>The services of the regiment during the campaign
of 1695 were limited to covering the siege
of <em>Namur</em>, one of the strongest fortresses in Europe,
and garrisoned by 15,000 men, commanded
by a Marshal of France (Boufflers). When the
siege was formed, the regiment was detached to
graze the horses between Charleroi and Mons; it
was subsequently engaged in manœuvring to protect
the besieging forces from the attacks of the
French army. In the beginning of August the
regiment was encamped at Waterloo, and subsequently
in the immediate vicinity of Namur. This
fortress was eventually captured, and this event
was considered the brightest feature in King William's
military history, and one upon which he was
often heard to declare his satisfaction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>After passing the winter in Ghent, the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was brigaded with the regiments of Lumley and
Schomberg (now 1st and 7th Dragoon Guards),
and was reviewed by the King on the 30th of
May, 1696, "and made a very noble appearance."
It served the campaign of this year under the Prince
of Vaudemont in Flanders; and was encamped&mdash;first
at Marykirk, and subsequently along the canal
between Ghent and Bruges, to protect these places,
with Nieuport, and the other maritime towns of
Flanders, from the attacks of the enemy. A French
army was encamped on the opposite side of the canal,
and several skirmishes occurred, but no general
engagement took place.</p>

<p>On the night of the 20th of September, Colonel
Langston crossed the canal with a squadron of this
regiment and a party of dragoons, and attacking
one of the French outposts, defeated the guard and
took thirty prisoners. The Prince of Vaudemont
reviewed the regiment a few days after this event,
and on the 5th of October it left the camp for
winter-quarters in Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>The regiment having been selected to form part
of the army of Brabant during the campaign of
1697, it marched out of its winter-quarters in the
early part of May, and pitched its tents at St.
Quintin Linneck on the 16th of that month, and
was formed in brigade with Leveson's, Windham's,
and Galway's regiments (2nd and 6th Dragoon
Guards, and a regiment of French Protestants.)
It took part in several manœuvres, and during the
night of the 12th of June it retired with the army
through the forest of Soigne, and took post before
Brussels, to protect that city from a siege. The
regiment was subsequently encamped near Wavre,
where it remained until peace was restored by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Treaty of Ryswick<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, which was signed in September.
It afterwards marched to Ghent, and during
the winter embarked for England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1698</div>

<p>After its return from foreign service the regiment
was quartered at Northampton, Banbury, and
Wellingborough; and, the House of Commons
having voted that only 10,000 regular troops should
be kept in pay in England, it was ordered, in February,
1698, to march to Highlake, in Cheshire,
and to embark for Ireland.</p>

<p>Having landed at Dublin on the 31st of March,
the regiment was placed on the Irish establishment,
and the rates of pay of the non-commissioned officers
and soldiers were reduced; the troops in Ireland
being on a lower rate of pay than those in
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1699</div>

<p>The establishment of the regiment was fixed by
a warrant under the sign-manual, bearing date the
1st of May, 1699, at the following numbers:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the same year His Majesty issued an order&mdash;'That
whatever regiment, troop, or company shall
be on duty in Dublin, there is to be allowed unto
each private horseman 3<em>d.</em> per diem, and to each
private foot soldier 1<em>d.</em> per diem, over and above
what is otherwise established<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.' The troopers of
this regiment were the first to derive the advantages
given by this order, as they were on Dublin
duty at the time it was issued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701<br />1702</div>

<p>The decease of King James having taken place
at St. Germains, in September, 1701, the King of
France (Louis XIV.) proclaimed the pretended
Prince of Wales King of Great Britain by the
style and title of James III.: this event, with the
elevation of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of
Spain in violation of the most solemn engagements,
was followed by a sanguinary war with France and
Spain, and a British force proceeded to the Netherlands.
This regiment was not, however, employed
on foreign service during the war; the proclamation
of the Pretender, with the death of King William
III., which occurred in March, 1702, had
revived the hopes of the Papists; and the partisans
of the Stuart dynasty were conspiring to effect
the elevation of the Pretender to the throne of these
kingdoms. Queen Anne, therefore, deemed it expedient
to detain in Ireland a few trusty corps of
approved devotion to the Protestant interest, and
<span class="smcap">Brigadier-General Langston's</span> Regiment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Horse was selected to remain in that kingdom.
This honourable distinction necessarily prevented
the regiment sharing in the many glorious victories
gained by the forces under the great Duke
of Marlborough, where five regiments of British
horse (now the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th Dragoon
Guards) acquired never-fading laurels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>In 1703 the regiment was again employed on
Dublin duty, and on the 24th of July it was reviewed
near that city by his grace the Duke of
Ormond, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, who expressed
his admiration of its appearance and discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>For many years subsequent to this period there
was little diversity in the services of the regiment:
it was usually stationed at or near Dublin, occasionally
occupying dispersed cantonments in more
remote parts of the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706<br />1709<br />1710</div>

<p>During the summer of 1706 the regiment was
encamped on the Curragh of Kildare. On the
21st of April, 1709, two troops attended the Earl
of Wharton, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, at
his public entry into Dublin; and on the 7th of
May, 1710, two troops escorted his lordship into
Dublin, on his return from England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>Lieutenant-General Francis Langston having
retired from the service, the Colonelcy of the regiment
was conferred, through the interest of James
Duke of Ormond, on Brigadier-General George
Jocelyn, from the Second Troop (now Second Regiment)
of Life Guards, by commission dated the
20th of October, 1713.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714<br />1715</div>

<p>After the accession of King George I. in 1714,
the Duke of Ormond being removed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
command of the army, Brigadier-General Jocelyn
sold his commission and quitted the service; and
was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifth
Horse</span> by Major-General Sherrington Davenport,
from the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the First
Troop (now First Regiment) of Life Guards, his
commission bearing date the 9th of February,
1715.</p>

<p>About this period the distinguishing colour, or
facing, of the regiment was changed from <em>white</em> to
<em>light blue</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>When the rebellion of the Earl of Mar, in
favour of the Pretender, broke out in Scotland, the
<span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span> were directed to hold themselves
in readiness to proceed to England on the shortest
notice; but the rebellion was suppressed by the
forces under the Duke of Argyle, without the aid
of this corps being required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1718</div>

<p>Tranquillity having been restored, the establishment
of the regiment was reduced to 24 private
men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719<br />1732</div>

<p>The decease of Major-General Davenport occurred
on the 2nd of July, 1719; and on the 6th
of that month King George I. conferred the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span> on Major-General
Owen Wynne, from a Regiment of Dragoons,
now 9th Lancers: this officer commanded the
regiment upwards of thirteen years, and was
removed, in August, 1732, to the Royal Irish
(late Fifth) Regiment of Dragoons.</p>

<p>In September, 1732, King George II. appointed
Lieutenant-General Thomas Pearce to the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>, from the 5th
Regiment of Foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>Lieutenant-General Pearce commanded the regiment
seven years, and, dying in the summer of
1739, was succeeded in the Colonelcy by Major-General
James Lord Tyrawley, from the Royal
Regiment of Fusiliers, his commission bearing
date the 26th of August, 1739.</p>

<p>On the 27th of the following month the regiment
formed part of a splendid cavalcade which
attended his grace the Duke of Devonshire on
his arrival at Dublin as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
from the water-side to the castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>The decease of Charles VI., Emperor of Germany,
having been followed by a contest between
his daughter, the Archduchess Maria-Theresa and
the Elector of Bavaria, respecting the sovereignty
of Bohemia and Hungaria, King George II. resolved
to support the house of Austria;&mdash;the
strength of the army was augmented, and 10 men
and horses were added in 1740 to each troop of
the <span class="smcap">Fifth</span> Regiment of Horse.</p>

<p>During the summer of this year (1740) the populace
of Dublin broke out into open riot, committing
many acts of violence and outrage, in consequence
of a scarcity of corn, and <span class="smcap">Tyrawley's Horse</span>
were ordered out and directed to patrole the streets
night and day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741<br />1742<br />1743</div>

<p>In April of the following year a further augmentation
of nine men per troop was made to the
establishment; and in 1742 a British army was
sent to Flanders to support the pretensions of the
Archduchess Maria-Theresa, as Queen of Hungaria,
against the power of France and the Elector
of Bavaria; but this regiment was detained in
Ireland. In the beginning of 1743 the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
furnished a draft of ten men and horses per troop
to join the regiments of horse on foreign service.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Lord Tyrawley, after commanding
the regiment nearly four years, was
removed to the Colonelcy of the Second Troop of
Horse Grenadier Guards, and the command of the
<span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span> was conferred on Colonel John
Brown from the Ninth Dragoons, his commission
bearing date the 1st of April, 1743.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>In the beginning of the following year another
draft of men and horses was sent on foreign service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>In April, 1745, the regiment was reviewed at
Maryborough by Major-General de Grangues; and
after the rebellion headed by Charles Edward,
eldest son of the Pretender, broke out in Scotland,
this regiment was ordered to Dublin, and the
army in Ireland was placed in dispersed cantonments
near the coast to resist any descent which
might be attempted upon the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>After the suppression of the rebellion in Scotland,
three of the four regiments of <em>Horse</em> in England
were reduced to the quality of <em>Dragoons</em> (25th
December, 1746), and styled <em>Dragoon Guards</em>,
and this regiment obtained the designation of the
<span class="smcap">First Irish Horse</span>. The regiments of horse on
the Irish establishment (now the 4th, 5th, 6th, and
7th Dragoon Guards) were frequently designated
by the colour of their facings; the <span class="smcap">First</span> being
frequently called the <em>Blue Horse</em>; the <em>Second</em> the
<em>Green Horse</em>; the <em>Third</em>, the <em>Carabiniers</em>; and
the <em>Fourth</em> the <em>Black Horse</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>A treaty of peace was concluded with France
and Bavaria at Aix-la-Chapelle in the winter of
1748-9; and, while the negociations were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
progress, the establishment of the <span class="smcap">First Irish
Horse</span> (with that of all other regiments of horse
and dragoons in Ireland) was reduced to twenty-one
private men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1751, a warrant was issued
under the sign-manual, regulating the uniform,
colours, and standards of the regiments of the line,
from which the following particulars are extracted
respecting the <span class="smcap">First Irish Horse</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">1753<br />1754</div>

<p>In May, 1753, the regiment was reviewed by
Major-General Blyth at Carlow, and immediately
afterwards marched to Dublin; in 1754 it was
reviewed by the Earl of Rothes at Philipstown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>During the summer of 1756 detachments from
the regiments of horse and dragoons in Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with the whole of the Second and Third Regiments
of Horse, were encamped at Kilkenny, with the
view of establishing a uniform system of drill and
manœuvre in the cavalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>Another war having commenced with France,
some preparations were made in 1759 to resist a
menaced descent in Ireland by 28,000 French
under the Duke of Aguillion, and the <span class="smcap">First
Irish Horse</span> were directed to hold themselves in
readiness to march on the shortest notice.</p>

<p>In the early part of December of this year the
regiment was employed in suppressing riots in
Dublin, occasioned by a supposition that an union
with England was in contemplation. The rioters
broke into the House of Lords, and committed
other outrages, but were eventually suppressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760<br />1762</div>

<p>The regiment furnished a draft of twelve men
and horses, in February, 1760, to complete the
Third and Fourth Horse to forty-nine men per
troop, previous to their embarkation for Germany;
and another draft of twenty-two men was ordered
in the spring of 1762. During the latter year the
regiment was directed to recruit in Ireland, the
cavalry corps having, previously to this period,
usually procured recruits from England. In a few
years afterwards the ranks of the <span class="smcap">First Irish
Horse</span> were composed almost exclusively of
Irishmen.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Brown died in the summer of this
year, and was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the
regiment by Colonel James Johnston, from the
Lieut-Colonelcy of the Royal Horse Guards, by
commission dated the 3rd of August, 1762.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>At this period commotions and tumults prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in various parts of Ireland to a most alarming extent;
and in the beginning of 1763 the troops
were employed in assisting the high sheriffs and
magistrates in dispersing and securing bands of
rioters known by the name of <em>levellers</em>. The
head-quarters of the <span class="smcap">First Horse</span> were at Carlow,
and detachments were furnished to assist the
civil power. In May, 1763, the regiment proceded
to Dublin; in July it was ordered to march to the
county of Monaghan to form escorts for the judges
in their circuits; and subsequently Lieutenant-Colonel
Roberts (commanding the regiment at
Monaghan) was directed to furnish such detachments
as Charles Coote, Esq., justice of the peace,
should require to suppress riots, the county of
Cavan being in a very disturbed state.</p>

<p>A treaty of peace having been concluded with
France, the two regiments of horse returned from
Germany, and the establishment of this regiment
was reduced to twenty private men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>The regiment was again employed on Dublin
duty in 1764,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and while there, orders were received
for all the regiments of horse and dragoons,
excepting the light dragoons, to be mounted on
long-tailed horses; all the English horse and dragoons
were originally mounted on long-tailed
horses, but the fashion of the short dock was introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>about the close of the seventeenth and
beginning of the eighteenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The regiment
was also directed to discontinue the white
lace on the button-holes of the waistcoat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765<br />1766</div>

<p>The regiment having been relieved from Dublin
duty, its head-quarters were established in January,
1765, at Tullamore, from whence it marched in
July to Birr, Maryborough, and Mount Mellick.
In December of this year a ration of forage was
fixed at 28 lbs. of hay, 7 lbs. of oats, and 6 lbs. of
straw. During the following year the establishment
of the regiment was reduced to 19 private
men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767</div>

<p>In January 1767 the <span class="smcap">First Horse</span> were again
stationed at Dublin; and were reviewed in the
fifteen-acres in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Phoenix Park on the 22nd'">Phœnix Park on the 22nd</ins> of that
month, by the Earl of Granard, who was pleased
to express his approbation of their appearance
and discipline. They were withdrawn from Dublin
in May, and proceeded to Carlow, but returned
in the following month; and in December
marched to Philipstown. Sword-belts suspended
across the right shoulder, which had been used
by the horse more than half a century, were this
year adopted by the dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>From Philipstown the regiment removed to
Tullamore, where its head-quarters were established
in the beginning of 1768. In a return of
the distinctions of the regiment in Ireland, dated in
February of this year, the <span class="smcap">First Horse</span> are stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>to have <em>deep blue facings, buff waistcoats and
breeches, white lace, and white metal buttons</em>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>On the 24th of May the regiment was reviewed
by Major-General Lambert; and in June the head-quarters
were removed from Tullamore to Maryborough,
where the regiment was reviewed on
the 9th of June, 1769, by the Earl of Drogheda.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1769</div>

<p>Some alterations were this year (1769) made in
the uniform of the regiment;&mdash;the coats were
made with half-lappels, a red stripe was introduced
into the lace, and the colour of the horse-furniture
was changed from <em>light</em> to <em>dark blue</em>.
The cavalry officers were directed to wear their
sashes with the fringe upon the right side, and
the infantry officers upon the left, and the officers
of the regiments of horse were directed to wear
their sword-belts across the right shoulder, over
the waistcoat and under the coat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770</div>

<p>A change of cantonments, took place during the
winter, and in January, 1770, the head-quarters of
the regiment were at Kilkenny; but they were
again established at Maryborough in July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771<br />1772<br />1773<br />1774<br />1775</div>

<p>In the summer of 1771 the regiment marched
to Dublin, and was reviewed by the Lord-Lieutenant
in July, in the Phœnix Park.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> After
performing duty at the capital until December, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>marched into country quarters, and occupied for
short periods Tullamore, Philipstown, Carlow,
and Maryborough, during the three succeeding
years; and in the summer of 1775 was again
stationed at Dublin.</p>

<p>Major-General Johnston having been removed
to the 11th Dragoons, His Majesty conferred the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">First Horse</span> on Major-General
James Johnston (cousin of the former colonel of
the same name), from the Ninth Dragoons, by
commission dated the 27th of April, 1775.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>The British colonies in North America having
rebelled against the mother-country, the regiment
furnished in February, 1776, a draft of sixteen
troop-horses to be sent to North America and employed
in that country as the service required;
180 horses were sent from the cavalry corps in
Ireland, and 16 guineas were allowed to the regiment
for each horse. In July an augmentation of
one corporal and 10 private men per troop was
made to the establishment; parties of mounted
men were sent out to enlist recruits, and directions
were given that none but Protestants be engaged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777<br />1778</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1777 the regiment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
again in cantonments in the country, the head-quarters
being at Castlebar, from whence they were
removed in June to Roscommon, &amp;c., but returned
to Castlebar in the winter, and in May, 1778, proceeded
to Birr, where the regiment was reviewed,
on the 24th of that month, by Major-General De
Burgh. While at this station the officers were
ordered to provide themselves with tents, and to be
in constant readiness to take the field. In June
the head-quarters were removed to Belfast, in July
to Armagh, and in September returned to Belfast.</p>

<p>In April, 1778, Lieutenant-General James Johnston
was removed to the Enniskillen Dragoons,
and was succeeded in the command of the <span class="smcap">First
Horse</span> by Major-General George Warde, from the
14th Dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779<br />1780<br />1781</div>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1779, the regiment marched
to Lisburn, and in July the head-quarters were
established at Belturbet. At this station they
appear to have remained until July, 1781, when
they were removed to Athlone, where the regiment
was reviewed by Major-General Massey on the
2nd of August, and soon afterwards proceeded to
Dublin, but in November returned to Athlone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782<br />1783</div>

<p>The regiment was again reviewed by Major-General
Massey, on the 21st of June, 1782, at
Athlone, from whence it marched, in a few days
afterwards, to Mount Mellick, and, in January of
the following year, to Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>From Dublin the regiment proceeded, in July,
1784, to Tullamore. Its establishment, at this
period, was 21 officers, 174 non-commissioned
officers and private soldiers, and 133 troop-horses;
but the American war having been terminated by
acknowledging the independence of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
States, the numbers of the regiment were reduced
10 men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<p>Major-General Sir Henry Calder reviewed the
regiment at Tullamore on the 4th of June, 1785,
and on the 9th it marched to Nenagh, from whence
a detachment of one corporal and six private men
was sent to Dublin, where parties from every
cavalry regiment in Ireland were assembled to
establish an uniform system of horsemanship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1786<br />1787</div>

<p>After remaining upwards of a year at Nenagh,
the regiment marched, in July, 1786, to Carlow,
where it passed the succeeding twelve months, and
in July, 1787, proceeded to Longford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788</div>

<p>While at this station, His Majesty's commands
were conveyed to the regiment for converting it
from a corps of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> into a corps of <span class="smcap">Dragoons</span>,
with the title of <span class="smcap">Dragoon Guards</span>.
The following is a copy of the order for this
change:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>'It is His Majesty's pleasure that the four
regiments of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> on this establishment be
converted to <span class="smcap">Dragoon
Guards</span>, according to the
number specified in the
margin: this regulation to
take effect from the 1st of
April next inclusive; and,
in consequence of the
alteration of the establishment
of the regiments of
horse, His Majesty has
been pleased to direct that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
compensation shall be made to every officer of
the four regiments of horse, for the reduced pay
of each, of which a proper scheme shall be made
known as soon as the same can be digested. His
Majesty has also been pleased to signify, that,
in the change now proposed, it is not intended
that any injury shall be sustained by the
Colonels of the regiments, and that a compensation
will be made to them for any reduction of
pay or emolument they may suffer by the change;
and also, that they will be reimbursed such
reasonable extra expense as will be necessary for
altering their present accoutrements, as likewise
for the clothes, accoutrements, &amp;c., of the augmented
numbers, proper estimates of which will
be immediately delivered to the Commander-in-Chief,
to be laid before his Excellency the Lord
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>'Such men of the regiments of horse as choose
to re-enlist will receive a bounty of two guineas,
excepting such corporals as shall be made serjeants,
and, in consequence, have their pay
advanced. I am to inform you that in all other
respects the regiments of <span class="smcap">Dragoon Guards</span> are
to conform to all His Majesty's regulations
relative to the regiments of <span class="smcap">Dragoons</span>.</p>

<p class="right smcap padr2">'William Fawcett,</p>
<p class="right">'<em>Adjutant-General</em>.'</p>
</div>

<p>The compensation granted to the Colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> was 150<em>l.</em> per annum
for life, with 180<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> for the alterations in the
equipment; the Lieut.-Colonel received 575<em>l.</em>;
Major, 525<em>l.</em>; Captains, each 475<em>l.</em>; Captain-Lieutenant
and Lieutenants, 350<em>l.</em>; and the
Cornets each 250<em>l.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The establishment of the regiment was fixed at
1 colonel and captain, 1 lieutenant-colonel and
captain, 1 major and captain, 3 captains, 6 lieutenants,
6 cornets, 1 chaplain, 1 adjutant, 1 surgeon,
6 quarter-masters, 6 serjeants, 12 corporals,
6 trumpeters, 114 private men, and 6 dismounted
men. The carbines were cut shorter; the width
of the belts was reduced from 4½ to 3 inches;
and the officers were directed to wear their sword-belts
over their coats when on duty, and when off
duty over their waistcoats. The standard for recruits
was fixed at from 5 feet 8½ inches, to 5 feet
11 inches.</p>

<p>The necessary alterations having been completed,
and the regiment constituted the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Dragoon Guards</span>, its head-quarters were established
at Belturbet; and on the 18th of April
His Majesty was graciously pleased to approve of
its bearing the title of the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Regiment
of Dragoon Guards</span>, in consideration of
its long and faithful services in Ireland<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790<br />1791<br />1792</div>

<p>From Belturbet the regiment marched on the
1st of May, 1790, for Dublin, where it was
reviewed on the 20th of August by Major-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Lyon, and in August, 1791, by Major-General
White, and again by the same officer in May,
1792. In July of the latter year it marched from
Dublin to Carlow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>During the period the regiment lay at Carlow,
the violent republicans of France, who had previously
overturned the ancient form of government
in that country, were guilty of the atrocious conduct
of beheading their King and Queen, and of
involving the kingdom in scenes of outrage,
massacre, and devastation. These proceedings
were followed by a war between Great Britain
and the regicide Government of France; and the
establishment of the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon
Guards</span> was augmented in August, 1793, to 334
non-commissioned officers and privates, and 276
troop horses.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a British army, commanded by
His Royal Highness the Duke of York, had proceeded
to the Netherlands, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish
Dragoon Guards</span> marched on the 10th of
August, 1793, for Dublin, where they embarked
in October for England, in the expectation of
proceeding to join the Duke of York's army in
Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794<br />1795<br />1796</div>

<p>After its arrival in England, the regiment was
stationed at Nottingham, and its establishment was
further augmented to nine troops of 56 men per
troop. The order for its proceeding on foreign
service was, however, rescinded, and it was
directed to return to Ireland. It accordingly
marched from Nottingham to Liverpool, where it
embarked in the winter of 1795, and after landing
at Dublin, halted a short time in that city, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
afterwards proceeded into cantonments in the
country, the head-quarters being established at
Belturbet. While stationed at this place, the
establishment was augmented (1st April, 1796) to
65 rank and file per troop, making a total of 612
officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholics of Ireland had, for some
years past, been combining against the British
government, forming secret associations, and committing
numerous acts of outrage and murder upon
the Protestants, and at this period they were preparing
for open resistance; a military organization
was secretly taking place in several counties,&mdash;fire-arms
were procured, and pikes manufactured.
Several Irishmen of property, who had been implicated
in treasonable practices, had fled to France,
through whose agency application was made, by
the disaffected in Ireland, to the French Government,
for a force to assist them in breaking their
connection with England, and in establishing their
independence as a republic. The French Directory
cherished a decided antipathy to the British, as a
people from whose firm determination, constancy
of purpose, and immense resources the towering
expectations of their republic were likely to be
brought down. The proposal from Ireland was
consequently acceded to, and an armament was
prepared at Brest, with transport for 25,000 men,
to be commanded by General Hoche. The
assemblage of shipping and troops at Brest, with
the agitated state of Ireland, occasioned the army
in that kingdom to be augmented; and the country
to be divided into five military districts. On
the 24th of December the French fleet appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in Bantry Bay. The <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon
Guards</span> were immediately despatched to oppose
the enemy, and had a most harassing march from
Belturbet to Bantry in severe and inclement
weather.</p>

<p>Some misunderstanding appears to have occurred
between the French Directory and Irish
malcontents, respecting the period when the troops
were to arrive; the Irish were not prepared to
rise at this time, and they were overawed by the
number of the King's troops near the coast. The
French fleet was partly dispersed by a storm, and
the remainder of the force, alarmed at the preparations
made to oppose their landing, returned to
France. After the departure of the hostile fleet
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> marched back
to their former quarters, and occupied Belturbet
and the adjacent towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>In the spring of 1797 the establishment was
augmented to 703 officers and men, at the same
time a second Lieut.-Colonel and a second Major
were added to the regiment. In August of this year
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> encamped on the
Curragh of Kildare, together with the 5th, 6th,
and 7th Dragoon Guards, and 5th and 9th Dragoons;
and these corps were reviewed in September
by Lieut.-General Sir David Dundas, who
issued very complimentary orders on the occasion.
The camp broke up in October, when the regiment
marched to Maryborough, with detachments
at Mount Mellick and Ballinakill.</p>

<p>During this year some alterations were made in
the equipment of the regiment: the large carbines
were exchanged for others of a smaller size; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the pair of large pistols for a single pistol; and the
saddles were also considerably reduced in size.
Lappels to the coats and silver lace on the men's
hats were discontinued; and the colour of the
waistcoats was changed from buff to white.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>In the succeeding year the disaffected in Ireland
broke out into open rebellion. Their leaders,
having received fresh promises of aid from France,
became confident of having their hopes and wishes
accomplished, and the 22nd of May, 1798, was
appointed for a general rising. The government
had taken measures to meet the coming danger;
a numerous yeomanry force was embodied; the
regular troops were kept in constant readiness for
active service; and, information of the designs of
the insurgents having been procured, the leaders
were seized and imprisoned, and the plan of the
rebellion was disorganized. The passions of the
misguided peasantry had, however, been wrought
into fury and madness by all the motives which
bigotry, hope of personal advantage, and thirst for
vengeance could inspire, and the rebellion, so long
suppressed, broke out with accumulated horrors.
During the whole of its continuance the <span class="smcap">Royal
Irish Dragoon Guards</span> were constantly employed
in this painful and unnatural warfare.</p>

<p>The regiment, having marched from Maryborough,
was detached to the different towns near
Dublin, where the rebels were in force. Captain
William Smith's troop was stationed at <em>Naas</em>,
with a party of fencible cavalry and another of
Armagh militia. This town was attacked on the
24th of May by two thousand rebels: their first
attempt was upon the county jail, where they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
repulsed with great loss; and they then possessed
themselves of all the principal avenues to the town,
and made a simultaneous attack on the posts occupied
by the troops. The wild and disorderly
rush of the undisciplined multitude was opposed by
the troops with firmness, and after a contest of an
hour's duration, the rebels were repulsed with the
loss of one-hundred and forty men left dead in the
streets. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> and
fencibles charged several times and slaughtered
many of the rebels in the pursuit. The regiment
had Quarter Master Rowayne and private Hughes,
with eleven horses killed; and ten men and a
number of horses wounded. This loss was occasioned
by the rebel pikemen.</p>

<p>During the night a party of rebels set fire to the
barracks at <em>Prosperous</em>, where one officer and
twenty-eight men of the militia perished: a party
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> was also surprised
in quarters and nearly every man put to
death: a few men were taken prisoners and afterwards
butchered by the insurgents with the most
inhuman cruelty. A party of fencibles was also
surprised and murdered at Dunboyne; and the
same misfortune befel a party of the Suffolk militia
escorting baggage to Kildare. A number of
other towns were attacked: in some instances the
rebels were successful, in others they were defeated;
and on the 25th, 26th, and 27th of May
numerous skirmishes occurred, and civil war with
all its horrors raged in the heart of Ireland.</p>

<p>A body of rebels attempted to surprise <em>Carlow</em>,
which was garrisoned by detachments of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> and Ninth Dra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>goons,
with some Yeomanry, Militia, and Volunteers,
amounting to about 450 men. The rebels
assembled nearly 3000 strong on the estate of Sir
William Crosbie, Bart., who led them to the attack;
and after a sharp conflict they were defeated,
with the loss of 500 men killed, and many prisoners,
including their leader, who was immediately
tried by martial law and hanged.</p>

<p>Numerous encounters occurred in other parts of
the country; and on the 30th of May a detachment
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>, with a
party of fencibles and Antrim militia, proceeding
under the command of Colonel Walpole to join
Major-General Loftus at <em>Gorey</em>, arrived at a place
where the road was low and narrow, with high
clay banks on each side crowded with bushes, and
beyond them deep trenches, where they were attacked
by an ambush of rebels of overwhelming
numbers. The cavalry, by repeated charges to
the front and right, endeavoured to extricate themselves,
but their utmost efforts could not avail
against the immense numbers by which they were
opposed; and after an unequal fight of an hour's
duration, in which their commanding officer, Colonel
Walpole, and many men and horses were
killed, they were forced to retire, covered by the
militia, and had the mortification of losing three
guns. About the same date 15,000 rebels took
Wexford, and in the beginning of June made an
attack upon New Ross, but were repulsed.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Enraged
at this failure, they murdered, at the instigation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>of their priests, 241 Protestant prisoners in
cold blood, and evinced, in this act, a ferocious
cruelty not exceeded by the savage barbarians of
the most uncultivated part of the world.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June Captain Sir Richard Steel
engaged, with his troop of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span>, a body of rebels posted at <em>Ovidstown</em>,
and the insurgents fought for some time with bravery,
but were eventually dispersed with great
slaughter. The troop had one serjeant, two
rank and file, and three horses killed; with nine
men and a number of horses wounded. Captain
Sir Richard Steel had his horse killed under him,
and was himself severely wounded.</p>

<p>About the same period a body of rebels attacked
the first, or Colonel's, troop of this regiment, at
<em>Goff's Bridge</em>, when the Dragoon Guards repulsed
the furious onsets of their reckless opponents with
signal gallantry, and drove back the insurgents
with loss.</p>

<p>Part of the regiment afterwards proceeded to
<em>Arklow</em>, in the neighbourhood of which place the
rebels were in great force. On the morning of the
9th of June, 30,000 insurgents advanced to attack
the town with three guns and such a multitude of
pikemen, that they appeared like a moving forest.
Thrice they attacked the town, headed by their
priests in clerical vestments, and evinced astonishing
intrepidity; but were unable to make any impression
on the steady valour of the King's troops,
though they had an advantage in numbers of twenty
to one. The celebrated Father Murphy was cut
in two by a cannon-ball while in the act of heading
one of the attacks, waving a green flag, and shouting
"Liberty or death." The contest was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>tinued
until evening; and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> and Fifth Dragoons repeatedly charged,
and in every instance routed the rebels with immense
loss. The Fencible regiment of Ancient
Britons also distinguished itself, and its Colonel,
Sir W. Williams Wynne, was overpowered, and a
rebel was in the act of piking him, when Corporal
James M'Connel, of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span>, rushed forward to his aid, and slew the
rebel. Captain William Smith also distinguished
himself at the head of his troop of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Dragoon Guards</span> in a particular manner. About
eight o'clock in the evening the rebels retreated,
leaving the ground literally covered with slain,
their loss being estimated at between 6000 and
7000 men.</p>

<p>After repulsing the enemy at Arklow, dispositions
were made for a combined attack of the
King's forces on the rebels' stronghold at <em>Vinegar
Hill</em>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in the neighbourhood of Enniscorthy; and
the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span> marched to
the scene of conflict under the orders of Major-General
Wilford. The design of the Commander-in-Chief
was to surround the post; and with this
view 15,000 men, with artillery in proportion, advanced
by four different routes. The <em>first</em> division
commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir David
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>Dundas; the <em>second</em> under Major-Generals Sir
James Duff and Loftus; the <em>third</em> under Major-General
Needham; and the <em>fourth</em> under Major-Generals
Johnson and Ross: the last was to attack
the town of Enniscorthy, situate at the base of the
hill, and to drive the rebels from thence. The
troops having arrived at their stations (excepting
Major-General Needham's division), the attack
commenced about seven o'clock on the morning of
the 21st of June, with a sharp cannonade. The
rebels sustained the fire of the artillery and troops
for nearly two hours, when they gave way and fled
through the space which should have been occupied
by the third division (hence called Needham's
gap) in the greatest confusion towards Wexford;
the cavalry galloped forward in pursuit, and made
a dreadful slaughter among the fugitives. In
their haste to escape from the sabres and bayonets
of the King's troops, the rebels left behind them
their cannon (fourteen pieces), with an immense
quantity of plunder collected from the neighbouring
towns and gentlemen's houses; also a number
of muskets, pistols, and swords, and a great quantity
of pikes, scythes, and other implements of
destruction. The loss of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> was, four men killed, and ten wounded;
besides a number of horses killed and wounded.
After the action the regiment proceeded to its
former quarters at Maryborough and Mount Mellick,
where it was kept in constant readiness for
further operations; and detachments were employed
on various services.</p>

<p>The remains of the rebel army continued to
make an unavailing resistance, and endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to force the passes which separate the counties of
Wexford and Carlow. On one occasion, a party
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> and a small
body of the Wexford militia disputed the passage
of the river Barrow at <em>Gore's Bridge</em>, against an
overwhelming force of rebels; after displaying
much intrepidity and heroism, and losing many
men in killed and wounded, the soldiers were
overpowered, and 27 taken prisoners: 7 of the
captives were supposed to be Orangemen, and
were instantly shot, and their fellow-soldiers were
forced to be their executioners.</p>

<p>In July, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>
marched, under the command of Colonel Thewles
(accompanied by Major-General Sir James Duff),
to attack, in conjunction with other troops, a considerable
body of rebels who had taken post at
<em>Kildare</em>. On the advance of the King's forces,
the insurgents, after a short resistance, set the
town on fire and retired to a position on the curragh
of Kildare. Here they were attacked, overpowered,
and routed by the cavalry, with a loss of
250 killed and many wounded. Previous to the
termination of this sanguinary affair, Lieutenant-General
Sir David Dundas arrived with a body
of troops, to whom the surviving rebels surrendered,&mdash;the
General having authority to give
protection to such of the insurgents as should lay
down their arms and return to their allegiance.</p>

<p>From this period the rebellion may be considered
suppressed; some of the most obstinate of
the rebels, however, continued in a body and committed
many enormities; and the French endeavoured
to revive the conflict by sending General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Humbert, with upwards of 1000 men, all desperate
characters, who landed at Killala on the 22nd
of August. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> were
immediately ordered to march for Connaught, but
the French having been made prisoners, the order
was countermanded, and the regiment returned to
its quarters at Maryborough. Thus was this unnatural
contest terminated; but the repeated atrocities
of the Catholics led to equally frightful retaliations,
and the sanguinary hatred engendered by
religious antipathy and a thirst for revenge produced
a fearful catalogue of crime after the rebels
were subdued. The loss of the insurgents during
this rebellion has been estimated at 50,000 men,
and that of the royalists at 19,000 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>Scarcely were the troubles in Ireland terminated
and the country restored to tranquillity, when the
regiment received orders to hold itself in readiness
for foreign service, and, having marched to Dublin,
it there received a draught of men and horses from
the 6th Dragoon Guards.</p>

<p>Embarking from Dublin in August, 1799, it
landed at Liverpool, from whence it proceeded by
forced marches to Northampton, expecting to form
part of the Anglo-Russian army, destined to attempt
to rescue Holland from the power of France;
but the Dutch not seconding the efforts made
for their deliverance, the troops were withdrawn,
and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> continued
at Northampton during the remainder of that
year.</p>

<p>During the summer the regiment received orders
to cut the horses' tails, which had been worn of the
natural length since 1764, and the operation occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>sioned
the loss of several valuable horses, which
died of locked-jaw.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>In the beginning of the following year the establishment
was augmented to ten troops, and the
total numbers to 850 officers and men. In February
the regiment marched from Northampton
for Scotland, and on its arrival occupied Hamilton
barracks; in the autumn it proceeded to Edinburgh,
where it remained nearly two years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the peace of Amiens with
the French government, the establishment of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> was reduced to eight
troops, and the total numbers to 550 officers and
soldiers and 500 troop horses. In August, 1802,
the regiment proceeded to Ireland, and, having
landed at Donaghadee, it occupied Belturbet, Longford,
and Enniskillen. This year the length of the
skirts of the men's coats was reduced, and the blue
half-lappels discontinued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>The peace, ratified in 1802, did not long 'diffuse
its blessings o'er the land.' The First Consul
of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, soon found opportunities
to violate the conditions of a treaty which
he never intended should be permanent,&mdash;merely
wishing to have the army of Great Britain disbanded
or reduced to a peace establishment, to
further his hostile views against the country; and
he ventured to make preparations to invade England.
Happily his designs were frustrated; the
spirit and energy of the British people were soon
roused; an extraordinary feeling of patriotism
pervaded the whole country,&mdash;the regular army
was augmented,&mdash;the militia called out,&mdash;the yeomanry
and volunteers enrolled,&mdash;and in a few months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a force of 500,000 men was prepared for any emergency.
Bonaparte's threat of invasion soon evaporated,
his proud spirit quailed before such a
mighty preparation, and he feared to attempt the
shores of Britain with his legions. The establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> was
augmented on this occasion to 670 officers and
soldiers.</p>

<p>After a service of sixty years the veteran General,
George Warde, died (11th March, 1803) in
the 78th year of his age, and was succeeded in the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span>
by Major-General Miles Staveley, whose regiment,
the 28th, or Duke of York's own Light Dragoons,
had been disbanded a few months previously to this
period.</p>

<p>In April of this year (1803) the regiment
marched to Longford and adjacent towns; and
the efficiency of the corps was increased by the
addition of three Captains to the establishment,
which released the Field Officers from the charge
of troops.</p>

<p>On the 16th December Captain Charles Dodgson,
who commanded the troop at Philipstown, went
in search of an outlaw, for whose apprehension the
government had offered a large reward: arriving
at the ruins of an old castle, where the rebel had
established himself, the captain summoned him to
surrender: he refused, and instantly fired at the
captain, and so severely wounded him as to occasion
his death in a few moments. This murder caused
a great feeling of regret in the regiment, by which
Captain Dodgson was much beloved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>In the spring of the following year it marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to Dublin, and embarked for England; and, after
landing at Liverpool, marched to Exeter, Truro,
Totness, and Honiton; and in December, 44 men
and 80 horses were added to the establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>The regiment quitted Devonshire and Cornwall
in the spring of 1805, for Kent, and was assembled
at Canterbury in May. On the 23rd of
August it was inspected by His Royal Highness
the Duke of York, and was honoured with his
royal approbation of the appearance and discipline
of the regiment. It was also inspected, on the 4th
of October, by its Colonel, Major-General Staveley,
who expressed great satisfaction at its condition.
During its stay at Canterbury its establishment
was augmented to 769 men and 769 troop horses.</p>

<p>In September of this year a regulation was established
in the regiment, for each man to pay 1<em>s.</em>
per month, and the sums thus produced to be invested
in the public funds, and to be designated <em>St.
Patrick's Fund</em>. From this fund every soldier, after
a continued contribution for twelve years or upwards,
was to receive, on his discharge, either the
whole amount of his subscription, or a yearly pension,
according to a fixed scale. Great advantages
have accrued to the men of the regiment from this
excellent institution. There are now (1838) 36
pensioners upon the fund, and the highest upon the
list receives 6<em>l.</em> 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> annually, after twenty-seven
years' contribution. The stock amounts to 3350<em>l.</em>
reduced 3 per cent. annuities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>The regiment quitted Canterbury in December,
on route for Scotland; and in February, 1806, was
established in quarters at Piershill barracks, Edinburgh,
with Hamilton and Glasgow; but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
recalled to England in a few weeks afterwards, and
occupied Manchester, Liverpool, and Chester.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August two troops were inspected
at Liverpool by His Royal Highness the Duke of
Gloucester, accompanied by the Duke of Clarence
(afterwards King William IV.); their Royal Highnesses
also saw the whole regiment at Manchester
on the 25th of September, and expressed their approbation
of its appearance and discipline in the
most flattering terms.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Lancashire
its establishment was augmented to ten troops;
and the total numbers to 904 officers and soldiers,
and 854 troop horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>The regiment was reviewed on the 9th of June,
1807, at Manchester, by Major-General Fisher;
and in the following month two troops marched to
Nottingham: in the autumn the regiment occupied
quarters at Birmingham (head-quarters),
Nottingham, Coventry, Manchester, Liverpool,
Chester, and Warrington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>In the summer of the following year great excitement
prevailed in the manufacturing towns in
Lancashire and the adjoining counties; and in
May a serious riot took place at <em>Manchester</em>, in
consequence of a bill, fixing the minimum of wages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>having been rejected by parliament: so great was
the violence of the rioters, that the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> and militia were obliged to use
violent means, and unfortunately eight men were
killed and several wounded. This severity did
not, however, prevent another body of weavers
assembling on the 1st of June, and committing
many acts of violence and outrage; and the cavalry
was again obliged to act. The weavers of other
towns were equally outrageous; and at Rochdale
they attacked and burnt the prison, and were only
prevented committing further mischief by the arrival
of a troop of the <span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon
Guards</span> from Manchester.</p>

<p>The disturbed state of the manufacturing towns,
and the numerous calls of the civil authorities for
the aid of a military force, occasioned much harassing
duty to the regiment throughout the summer,
and these services were rendered particularly painful
to the troops, from the necessity of frequently
using coercive measures to restrain the lawless
violence of the people.</p>

<p>In November Major-General Pigott inspected
the regiment at Birmingham, and expressed himself
gratified at finding it so effective after the severe
duties on which it had been employed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>During this year the men's hair, which had
been worn long and tied behind with a queue, was
ordered to be cut short; and in 1809 the use of
powder to the hair was abolished. An order was
also received for the appointment of troop serjeant-majors
in the place of troop quartermasters, when
vacancies occurred. A reduction of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
horses was also made to the establishment in 1808,
and again in 1809.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>Numerous changes of quarters took place during
the year 1809, and the spring of 1810, and in
the summer of the latter year the regiment occupied
York, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle, Beverley,
&amp;c. &amp;c. During the autumn and early part
of the winter of this year (1810) four troops (A.
B. C. and D.) were employed under Major Ross
in suppressing the riotous conduct of the workmen
in the coal-districts in the counties of <em>Northumberland</em>
and <em>Durham</em>, which, after much difficulty and
painful service, was happily effected to the satisfaction
of the coal-owners, who presented the regiment
with a handsome <span class="smcap">Silver Vase</span>, with the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'<span class="smcap">Presented</span> to the Mess of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span>, by the <span class="smcap">Coal-Owners</span>
on the rivers Tyne and Wear, as a
mark of grateful respect for services performed
by a part of that corps, called out in aid of the
civil power, in suppressing a riotous combination
of their workmen in the year 1810.'</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In November, 1810, and again in May, 1811,
the regiment was inspected by Major-General
Vyse, who passed very high encomiums on its
appearance and discipline. In June following it
marched to Radipole barracks, where it received
orders, on the 5th of July, for six troops to be
held in readiness to proceed on foreign service,
to join the army commanded by General the
Earl of Wellington, which was fighting against
the legions of Bonaparte in Portugal and Spain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and the establishment was augmented to 800 troop
horses. The six troops, amounting to 550 men,
and 534 horses, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Sherlock, embarked at Plymouth on the
24th of July, and, having a quick voyage, landed
at Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, on the 4th of
August.</p>

<p>The allied army under the command of Lord
Wellington was, at this period, on the frontiers of
Spain, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>, after
halting three weeks at the royal barracks at Belem
to refresh the horses, received orders to march up
the country and join Major-General Le Merchant's
brigade of heavy cavalry. Leaving Belem on the
1st of September, the regiment proceeded by Villa
Franca and Santarem, to Abrantes&mdash;a romantic-looking
town situate on the summit of a lofty precipice
on the right bank of the Tagus.</p>

<p>After occupying Abrantes and the adjacent
villages a few days, the regiment resumed its
march, and proceeded by Niza, and Villa Velha,
to Castello Branco, where it was reviewed by Lord
Wellington, who expressed his entire approbation
of the appearance and discipline of the corps, and
of the excellent quality and condition of the horses,
and ordered twenty of the lightest to be transferred
to the regiments of light dragoons. In October
the regiment marched to Bismula, subsequently
to Fundão, and from thence to Santa Combadão,
and after the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo was raised,
it proceeded into quarters for the winter at Fundão.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>When the siege of <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em> was resumed,
the regiment moved forward and formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
part of the force employed in covering the operation;
and whilst engaged in this service a scarcity
of forage was so severely experienced, that the
condition of the horses was much deteriorated.
After the capture of this fortress by storm on the
19th of January, 1812, some changes took place
in the cavalry brigades, and this regiment was
removed to Major-General Slade's brigade, which
consisted of the Third and <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> and First Royal Dragoons. This brigade
marched to Santa Combadão and adjacent
villages; and subsequently proceeded to the Alentego
to join the southern army, and cover the siege
of the important fortress of <em>Badajoz</em>. Marshal
Soult advanced with a strong French corps to relieve
the town; but it was taken by storm (6th
April) before his arrival. He then retired, leaving
a strong rear-guard at <em>Llerena</em>, towards which
place the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>, and other
cavalry corps, advanced; and the French troops at
this place were attacked and defeated on the 11th
of April, by the British cavalry.</p>

<p>The brigade, of which the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> formed part, was afterwards attached
to the army of the south under the command of
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, and was employed
in all the operations and movements performed
by that body of troops.</p>

<p>After the important victory gained by the main
army under Lord Wellington, on the 22nd of July,
at Salamanca, the army of the south advanced
upon Madrid, in which city the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> were stationed for several days; at the
same time Lord Wellington was engaged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
siege of Burgos. A powerful French army under
General Clausel having advanced to raise the siege,
while another army under Marshal Soult, and a
third under Joseph Bonaparte (who had been elevated
by his brother to the throne of Spain), were
advancing upon Madrid, Lord Wellington found
himself unable to cope with the combined forces
thus assembled to attack him, and he commenced
retreating upon Salamanca. At the same time Sir
Rowland Hill's corps withdrew from its forward
position, and after a long and toilsome retreat the
whole army was concentrated near Salamanca.
The French afterwards crossed the Tormes at
Alba de Tormes, and Lord Wellington retreated
across the Agueda and entered Portugal. During
this movement the troops suffered severely from the
inclemency of the weather and the want of provision:
the rain fell in torrents almost the whole of
the time; and the bad condition of the roads, added
to the scanty supply of forage, was particularly injurious
to the cavalry, and occasioned the death of
many horses of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>,
and other corps. The regiment was ordered into
quarters at Zarga Maior; from whence it marched,
towards the end of December, into cantonments at
Brozas.</p>

<p>Several alterations were this year made in the
clothing and appointments of the regiment: the
men's coats were altered to short coatees, with
blue collar and cuffs, and white bar lace with a
blue cord across the breast; the cocked hat and
white feather were discontinued, and a brass helmet,
having the crest surmounted with long black
horse-hair, was adopted. The horse appointments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
were changed from black to brown leather; the
leather saddle-bags to a cloth <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'valice'">valise</ins>; and sabretaches
were introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>Strenuous exertions were made during the winter
to render the regiment particularly efficient for
the ensuing campaign: men, horses, clothing, and
appointments, arrived from England, and the corps
was brought into the most perfect condition for the
field; when an order was given for four regiments
of cavalry to transfer their horses to the other corps
and proceed to England; and to the extreme regret
of the officers and men, who panted for an
opportunity to distinguish themselves in action
with the enemy, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>
was one of the regiments ordered to return home,&mdash;the
other three were the 9th, 11th, and 13th Light
Dragoons. The commanding-officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
Sherlock, used his utmost endeavours to
have the order rescinded, and to obtain permission
for the regiment to remain on foreign service, but
without avail; and the only <span class="smcap">St. Patrick's Day</span> the
<span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span> ever hailed with
sorrowful feelings was the one which brought the
order for the surrender of their horses to other
corps, and for their ceasing to form part of the
army under Lord Wellington's command.</p>

<p>Having transferred 220 horses to the First
Royal Dragoons, and 110 to the Third Dragoon
Guards, the dismounted men proceeded to Lisbon,
where they embarked for Portsmouth, and after
their arrival marched to Hilsea barracks. On the
3rd of June they re-embarked at Portsmouth, and
proceeded by sea to Hull, and from thence to
York, where the four depôt troops and heavy bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>gage
joined under the command of Major Ogilvie,
from Canterbury.</p>

<p>During the period the regiment was serving in
Portugal and Spain, it sustained, from change of
climate, sickness, fatigue, privation, and other
causes arising out of the arduous duties in which
it had been employed, a loss of 239 men, and 445
horses.</p>

<p>While on foreign service a schoolmaster-serjeant
was added to the corps, and that excellent institution,
the regimental school, was established under
the auspices of His Royal Highness the Duke of
York, whose kind care and attention to the interests
and welfare of the soldiers on numerous occasions
renders the memory of His Royal Highness
dear to every individual of the British army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>In October of this year (1813) the regiment
was inspected at York by Major-General Cheney,
who expressed great satisfaction at its appearance.
In the following spring it occupied quarters at
York, Sheffield, Newcastle, and Durham; from
whence it marched, in May, in divisions for Edinburgh,
and was there inspected by Major-General
Sir Granby Calcraft on the 29th and 30th of that
month: one squadron was afterwards stationed
at Haddington.</p>

<p>In the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'mean time the legions'">meantime the legions</ins> of Bonaparte had not
only been driven out of Spain, but he had also lost
that immense accession of territory which had been
acquired by the armies of France since the revolution;
and even the capital of their country had
fallen into the hands of the allied powers, who had
removed the tyrant of Europe, the perfidious
Emperor Napoleon, from his throne, and sent him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into exile, and had restored the Bourbon dynasty.
Thus tranquillity was restored in Christendom
under circumstances which warranted the anticipation
of a long period of peace and prosperity to
the nations of Europe. The strength of the
British army was consequently diminished, and the
establishment of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>
was reduced to eight troops, and the total to 545
men and 453 horses.</p>

<p>Soon after this reduction had been made in its
numbers, the regiment was ordered to proceed to
Ireland; it embarked at Port Patrick in the
middle of August, and after landing at Donaghadee,
it occupied Belturbet, Longford, Enniskillen,
Sligo and Mullingar.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Miles Staveley, who had held the
Colonelcy of the regiment upwards of eleven years,
died in September, 1814; and was succeeded by
Lieut.-General Sir Henry Fane, G.C.B., by commission
dated the 3rd of the following month.</p>

<p>A slight alteration was this year made in the
uniform: the bars of white lace across the breast
were discontinued, and two broad stripes of white
lace with a blue worm were placed down the front
of the coat and upon the cuffs; the jacked-leather
boots were also replaced by others of a lighter
description called Hessian boots;&mdash;the white plush
breeches, by white web pantaloons; and a blue
and white girdle (or sash) was adopted for the
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>The anticipations of a lengthened peace vanished
in the spring of 1815, and the long-wished for
repose of Europe was disturbed by Bonaparte,
who violated the conditions of his treaties and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
engagements, quitted the island of Elba, and once
more trod the soil of France. His former associates
in war flocked to his banner; his advance
was rapid and decisive; Louis XVIII. was forced
to vacate his newly-acquired throne and fly to the
Netherlands; and the edicts of Napoleon were
again issued from the Tuilleries. He was now
singly opposed to nearly the whole of Europe;
and, with the hardihood of desperation, he braved
the resentment of the united powers. The <span class="smcap">Royal
Irish Dragoon Guards</span> were not fortunate
enough to be again called on foreign service: but,
every power in Christendom increasing the
strength of its armies, the establishment of this
regiment was augmented ten men per troop, and
subsequently a further addition of 48 men and 128
horses was made to its numbers.</p>

<p>The battle of Waterloo disposed of Bonaparte
and his legions, and a few days of contest sufficed to
re-establish the tranquillity of Europe. The peace
then restored has continued, with the exception of
commotions in particular kingdoms, to shed its
benign influence over Christendom for a longer
period than on any former occasion during the two
preceding centuries; and knowledge, refinement,
arts, and manufactures have advanced to a state
beyond that to which they ever previously
attained.</p>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment were removed
from Belturbet to Tullamore in April,
1815; and various changes took place in the
stations of the detached troops<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The peace of Europe having been re-established,
the strength of the regular army was reduced, and
in August, 1816, the numbers of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Dragoon Guards</span> were decreased to 493 men
and 333 horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>In February, 1817, the head-quarters of the
regiment were removed to Dublin, and detachments
were stationed at Tullamore, Longford,
Kavan, Philipstown, and five other places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>The regiment assembled at Dublin in June,
1818, and having embarked for England, landed
at Bristol in the early part of July, and occupied
Radipole barracks, with two troops at Bristol, and
one at Taunton; and furnished a strong detachment
on revenue duty on the coast. In the autumn the
head-quarters were removed to Nottingham, and
the detached troops occupied Northampton and
Leicester. The regiment was inspected at this
station by Major-General Bolton, in October;
and again in May of the following year. In
December, 1818, the establishment was reduced
to 405 men and 273 horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>A change of quarters took place in June and
July, 1819, and the regiment was stationed at
York, Sheffield, Leeds, and Huddersfield. In the
middle of August five troops were employed in
suppressing riots at Leeds; and in September one
troop proceeded to Durham, in consequence of
some commotions among the people of that city.</p>

<p>A further alteration was made in the uniform
this year: the coats were made with long skirts,
with four bars of white lace with a blue worm
upon the sleeves, two bars on each side of the
collar; and four bars, two rows in each bar, across
the breast. The colour of the cloth overalls was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
changed to blue-grey, with a blue stripe down the
outside of the leg. The officers wore aiguillettes
on the right shoulder, and a stripe of silver lace on
their overalls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>The decease of His Majesty King George III.
having taken place on the 29th of January, 1820,
on the 31st of that month the troops of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Dragoon Guards</span> at head-quarters attended the
Lord Mayor, corporation, and societies of the city
of York in solemn procession, while making proclamation
of the accession of King George IV.;
and on the 8th of February, 1820, they marched in
procession at 8 o'clock, <span class="fs70">P.M.</span>, in funeral order to
York minster, where a solemn dirge and funeral
service was performed on the death of King
George III.</p>

<p>On the 11th of April three troops marched from
York to assist the civil power in suppressing some
serious disturbances which had occurred in the
neighbourhood of Wakefield. A collision afterwards
took place with the rioters near Sheffield,
when one sergeant, one private, and two horses
were wounded with pikes, many of which were
found in possession of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>Another change of quarters took place in
August of this year, and the regiment was
stationed at Newcastle upon Tyne, Carlisle, Penrith,
and Whitehaven; and in October it was
inspected by Major-General Sir Andrew Barnard,
at Newcastle. In March, 1821, it marched to
Scotland, and was stationed at Piershill barracks,
Edinburgh, Greenock, Irvine, and Ayr. On the
6th of June it was inspected by Major-General
Sir Thomas Bradford; and, in August, the esta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>blishment
was reduced to six troops. Previous to
this date the troops were classed according to the
colour of the horses, and the regiment consisted
of two black troops, two brown, two bay, one bright
bay, and one chestnut; when this reduction was
ordered, the horses of one of the black troops, and
of the chestnut troop, were transferred to the
others; the horses thus became mixed, and they
have since been trooped without reference to colour.
The reduced establishment was 27 officers, 24
serjeants, 18 corporals, 6 trumpeters, 6 farriers,
281 privates and 253 troop horses. In September
the regiment was again inspected by Major-General
Sir Thomas Bradford; and in a few days
afterwards the head-quarters were removed to
Glasgow, where five troops were stationed, and one
troop was quartered at Hamilton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>On the 10th of June, 1822, Major-General Sir
Thomas Bradford again inspected the regiment,
and expressed in strong terms his approbation of
its appearance and discipline on this and the
former occasion when he had seen the corps.</p>

<p>In July the regiment marched to Port Patrick,
where it embarked for Ireland; and after landing
at Donaghadee, the head-quarters were established
at Dundalk, and detachments were stationed at
Belturbet, Monaghan, Enniskillen, &amp;c.: on the
23rd of October it was inspected by Major-General
Egerton. An alteration was this year made in
the shape of the helmet; and a large bear-skin
crest was adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>The regiment marched from the northern district
in June, 1823, for Dublin, where it was reviewed
on the 12th of that month by Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Sir Colquhoun Grant, by whom its appearance and
discipline were commended. In a few days after
this review it was removed to Newbridge, and was
again inspected by the same officer in November
following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824<br />1825</div>

<p>In June, 1824, the regiment marched to the royal
barracks at Dublin, where it was inspected by
Major-General Sir Colquhoun Grant on the 12th
of July; and again on the 14th of May, 1825.
In June it marched to Cahir, Limerick, Clogheen,
and New Ross; and on the 20th of October it
was inspected by Major-General Sir Charles
Doyle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>From these quarters the regiment was withdrawn
in March, 1826, and proceeding to Dublin,
was there once more inspected by Sir Colquhoun
Grant, and afterwards embarked for Liverpool,
where it landed on the 29th of March. On the
31st it marched for Coventry, Birmingham, and
Abergavenny; and in July was inspected by
Major-General Sir Hussey Vivian.</p>

<p>In consequence of serious riots having taken
place at Dudley and Wolverhampton, two troops
marched to these places in the beginning of August.
Serious disturbances also occurred at Lichfield
during the election in the early part of September,
and much mischief would have been done, but
was prevented by the timely arrival of a troop of
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> from Birmingham.
The troops were obliged to act against the people
on several occasions, and a few persons were
wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>On the 8th of January, 1827, this regiment, in
common with the other corps of the army, testified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by articles of mourning, the general grief on account
of the death of His Royal Highness the Duke
of York, the Commander-in-Chief of the army.
The decease of His Royal Highness occurred on
the 7th of January, and the whole army had to
deplore the loss of a Prince who had justly obtained
the appellation of "The Soldiers' friend." He
was succeeded in the command of the army by the
Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>After the decease of Lieutenant-General Cartwright,
Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Fane,
G.C.B., was removed to the First Dragoon Guards,
and was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span> by Lieutenant-General
Sir George Anson, G.C.B., by commission
dated the 27th of February, 1827.</p>

<p>In April of this year the regiment marched to
Dorchester, and occupied also Christchurch, Trowbridge,
and Dursley; and was inspected on the
29th of April by Major-General Sir Hussey
Vivian.</p>

<p>In consequence of the Dorchester barracks requiring
repairs, two troops and the head-quarters
marched to Weymouth on the 1st of June. On
the 12th of July, Her Royal Highness the Duchess
of Clarence (afterwards Queen Adelaide) arrived
at Weymouth, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> had the honour of escorting Her Royal
Highness into the town, and of mounting a guard
of honour where she alighted. Her Royal Highness
left Weymouth on the following day with a
similar escort. The regiment had also the honour
of furnishing an escort for, and of receiving, the
Duke of Clarence (afterwards King William IV.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
when His Royal Highness passed through Dorchester.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August the regiment was again
inspected by Major-General Sir Hussey Vivian;
and in October the head-quarters returned to Dorchester.
In December, it furnished an escort and
a guard of honour for His Royal Highness Don
Miguel of Portugal on his visiting Dorchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>The lace across the breast of the coats was this
year discontinued, the coats were made to button
in front without lace, and the skirts lengthened:
four bars of lace were worn on the sleeve, and the
facing was directed to be a blue velvet. The
officers were ordered to wear two silver epaulettes
and an aiguillette; and the men brass scales on the
shoulders. At the same time the men's girdles
were discontinued, but the officers continued to
wear a crimson and gold sash with long pendent
tassels. In the following spring the colour of the
overalls was changed to dark blue, with a broad
stripe of silver lace for the officers, and of white
lace for the men. A blue great coat was also introduced
for the officers; and horse furniture<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of
dark blue cloth with a double row of broad silver
lace, with the King's cypher, crown, and the star
of St. Patrick on each corner: and a black bearskin
flounce.</p>

<p>Sir Hussey Vivian inspected the regiment on
the 13th of April, and repeated the expressions of
approbation he had invariably used on former occasions,
of its appearance and discipline. In May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>its quarters were changed to Exeter and Topsham
barracks, with one troop at Dursley, and Sir Hussey
Vivian made the autumnal half-yearly inspection
on the 25th of August. During the summer the
regiment had again the honour of furnishing travelling
escorts for the Duchess of Clarence; and in
September for Her Majesty the Queen of Portugal.</p>

<p>Gauntlet gloves were originally part of the
equipment of every cavalry soldier; but were replaced
by short gloves in the early part of the reign
of George III.; and in December of this year the
short leather gloves were laid aside and gauntlets
again adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829<br />1830</div>

<p>The regiment marched from its quarters in
Devonshire and Gloucestershire in April, 1829, for
the north of England, and occupied York, with
detached troops at Beverley and Newcastle upon
Tyne. In September, Sir Hussey Vivian again
inspected the regiment; and in April, 1830, it
marched for Scotland, and occupied quarters at
Piershill barracks, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Perth.
It was inspected on the 31st of May by Major-General
Sir Robert O'Callaghan, K.C.B.; and on
the 26th of June it was formed, with the remainder
of the garrison, at the mound of Edinburgh Castle
and fired a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i>, in consequence of the accession
of His Majesty King William IV. to the
throne.</p>

<p>Soon after His Majesty's accession orders were
given for all the army, excepting the Royal Horse
Guards, to wear <em>scarlet</em>; also for all the regular
forces to wear <em>gold</em> lace and embroidery, and the
militia silver. The lace and embroidery of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
silver from the period of its formation, were at
this period changed to <span class="smcap">Gold</span>.</p>

<p>On the 27th of October the regiment was inspected
by Major-General the Honourable Patrick
Stewart, who expressed himself in terms of approbation
of its appearance and discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>In April and May of the following year the troops
performed several marches and much extra duty in
consequence of the riotous conduct of the people
at the elections. Escorts were required for the
voters, and so violent were the rioters, that one man
was killed by a brick while proceeding to vote in
charge of a party of the military. Many of the
soldiers were knocked off their horses with stones,
and others had their helmets broken; yet such was
the exemplary patience and forbearance of the
soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>, under
these painful and trying circumstances, that not a
single civilian was hurt by them during the whole
period. During the riots at Ayr the prisoners in
the gaol rose against the turnkeys, whom they overpowered;
but a few men of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> arriving, they dismounted, entered the
gaol with loaded carbines, secured the prisoners
before they could effect their escape, and restored
order.</p>

<p>The usual half-yearly inspection was made by
Major-General Hon. Patrick Stuart on the 16th of
June; and on the 8th of September the regiment,
with the garrison at Edinburgh, assembled and
fired a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i>, on the occasion of the coronation
of King William IV. and Queen Adelaide.</p>

<p>A change of quarters took place towards the
end of September, and the regiment was stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
at Glasgow, Hamilton, and Haddington. It was
inspected by Major-General Sir Charles Dalbiac,
K.C.H., on the 29th of September; and its present
commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel James
Charles Chatterton was appointed to the regiment
on the 9th of December, in succession to Lieut.-Colonel
Ross, who exchanged to the half-pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>In March, 1832, one troop of the regiment
marched to Paisley to aid the civil power in suppressing
the riots which had occurred in that town.
On the 4th of April, the half-yearly inspection
was made by Major-General the Honourable Patrick
Stewart, and the regiment being on the eve
of its departure for Ireland, the Major-General
issued the following order.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1 right fs80">'<em>Glasgow, April, 1832.</em></p>

<p class="in2 smcap">'General Order.</p>

<p>'On the departure of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon
Guards</span> for Ireland, Major-General Stewart
takes the opportunity of expressing to the regiment
the great satisfaction its conduct has given
him during the period of upwards of a year and
a half that it has been under his command, and
during that time frequently under very trying
circumstances, when upon all occasions it has
evinced that steadiness, temper, and coolness, the
certain results of the high state of discipline
which the regiment has so eminently maintained.</p>

<p>'The Major-General requests that Lieutenant-Colonel
Chatterton, the officers and men of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>, will accept his best
wishes for their future prosperity and welfare.</p>

<p class="right padr4">'By Order of the Major-General,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment embarked at Glasgow in steam-vessels
for Belfast, and, after landing, occupied quarters
at Dundalk, Belturbet, Ballyshannon, and
Monaghan. On the 11th of May Major-General
Macdonell made the usual half-yearly inspection.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of this year,
the election riots, and other disturbances which
occurred in Ireland, occasioned the regiment much
harassing duty, detachments being almost constantly
on the march to aid the civil power.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September Lieut.-General Sir
Hussey Vivian inspected the regiment, and complimented
the officers and men very highly on
their appearance after the harassing duties they
had lately performed. On the 7th of October the
regiment was again inspected by Major-General
Macdonell.</p>

<p>Ireland continued in a disturbed state, and
during the autumn and winter the regiment was
employed in most fatiguing and painful services.
In one month the regiment furnished fifty-one
parties to assist the civil power in making tithe-collections,
quelling riots at fairs, dispersing illegal
meetings, or suppressing election riots; and each
of these parties was under the command of one or
more officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>In the spring of 1833 the head-quarters were
removed to Cahir, and the regiment occupied also
Limerick, Clonmell, and Carrick-on-Suir; and on
the 16th of April Lieut.-Colonel Chatterton had
the satisfaction to receive a letter from Major-General
Macdonell, expressing 'his perfect approbation
of the exemplary and excellent conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the regiment during its service in the northern
district.'</p>

<p>The half-yearly inspection was made by Major-General
Sir James Douglas in the beginning of
June. In September a squadron was employed
in suppressing the riots at Cahir races, where two
violent parties attacked each other, and the Dragoon
Guards separated the combatants; but unfortunately
several lives had been lost, and many of
the peasantry dangerously wounded.</p>

<p>On the departure of the Marquis of Anglesey
from Ireland the following order was issued.</p>

<p>'At a meeting of the inhabitants of the town

<p>'Whilst we consider your departure from

your gallant corps. Of the non-commissioned
officers and privates we feel the utmost pleasure
in bearing testimony to their orderly conduct,
evidently the result of inclination as well as of
the high state of discipline, and the good feeling
which so happily subsisted between them and the
inhabitants of every class during their stay in
these quarters.</p>

<p>'When we recollect the unexampled exertion
of yourself and the officers to promote the amusement

<p>The regiment marched from Cahir and the out-stations
on the 28th and 29th of April, and proceeded
to Cork, where the head-quarters were
established with detached parties at Ballincorrig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and Buttevant; and on the 4th of May a communication
was received from Major-General Sir
James Douglas, K.C.B., expressing his 'perfect
satisfaction at the conduct and high state of discipline
of the regiment whilst under his orders in
the South-western district.'</p>

<p>On the 23rd and 24th of May, the regiment was
inspected by Major-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B., and again, by the same officer,
on the 22nd of October; also by Lieut.-General
Sir Hussey Vivian, K.C.B., on the 3rd of the
latter month.</p>

<p>The lawless resistance of the peasantry to the
collection of tithes gave rise to additional duty
during the autumn and winter of this year; and
their violent conduct brought on collisions, which
had the painful result of producing loss of life.
Several persons were wounded at Ballincorrig on
the 18th of December. On the 20th a large and
tumultuous assembly of the peasantry at Gortroe,
near Rathcormac, showed much obstinacy and
lawless violence, attacking the military with sticks
and stones, and were fired upon, when ten were
killed and several wounded. The greatest excitement
prevailed, and the military were obliged to
assemble again on the 21st of December, and for
several days afterwards.</p>

<p>This year a new-pattern brass helmet with bear
skin crest was adopted, and the trumpeters' clothing
was directed to be Scarlet, distinguished by lace.</p>

<p>The elections which took place in January,
1835, occasioned the regiment much extra duty
and many harassing marches; and its conduct, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

<p>'Sir,&mdash;The elections being now over, and the
service on which so many of the troops under
your command have been for some weeks past
engaged being now nearly at an end, I feel
myself called upon to express to you the high
sense I entertain of the admirable conduct of
both officers and men, while employed in the
performance of a duty in its very nature harassing

<p>'According to all the reports which have been
under my cognizance, nothing could have exceeded
their coolness, patience, and forbearance.</p>

<p>'Their presence in aid of the police and civil
power (whose conduct is also above all praise)
generally insured the peace, where, but for their
the few occasions on which they were called upon
to act, they did so, strictly, in self-defence, and
not till they had been themselves assailed, and in
many instances severely injured.</p>

<p>'I have to beg you will convey to them my best
acknowledgments, and the assurance that I will,
without loss of time, lay before His Majesty
their claims to His Royal approbation.</p>

<p>'I cannot conclude this letter without offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
you my best thanks for the readiness with which
you have attended to every call made upon you,

<p>The regiment having completed three years'
service in Ireland, embarked at Cork on board of
steam-vessels in May, 1835, for Bristol, from
whence it marched to Brighton, with detached
troops at Canterbury, Chichester, and Horsham;
and relieved the Grenadier Guards in the duty at
the Royal Pavilion.</p>

<p>In July the regiment was inspected by Major-General
Sir Charles Dalbiac, who expressed himself
much pleased with its steadiness and discipline;
and on the 10th of August it was inspected
by Lieut.-General Lord Hill, the General Commanding-in-Chief,
who was pleased to direct Lieut.-Colonel
Chatterton to issue an order, stating that
'the appearance of the men and horses, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
discipline and interior economy of the regiment
were such as to merit his fullest approbation; and
that the squadron he had lately inspected at
Canterbury was also in the most perfect order.'</p>

<p>A riotous assemblage of people having taken
place at Steyning in opposition to the poor-laws,
one troop marched thither on the 11th of September,
and its timely arrival rescued the magistrates
and relieving officer from a situation of very great
danger. A troop also marched to Horsham for a
similar purpose on the 15th of September; and
another troop from Canterbury to Bath on the 20th
of October.</p>

<p>The Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span>
Lieut.-General Sir George Anson, G.C.B., inspected
the regiment on the 26th of October, and
directed the following paragraph to be inserted in
the orderly books.</p>

<p>'Lieut.-General Sir George Anson has the
greatest satisfaction in expressing his entire
approbation of the general appearance of his
regiment, and of the zeal and attention manifested
by all ranks to good order and discipline.'</p>

<p>Their Majesties King William IV. and Queen
Adelaide having arrived at the Royal Pavilion, the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Dragoon Guards</span> had the honour of
being on the King's duty for the first time since
the reign of William III. His Majesty heard the
records of the regiment read in the early part of
November, and expressed great interest and gratification
at hearing their contents.</p>

<p>In December a detachment of the regiment was
employed in aiding the civil power at Horsham;
and a letter of thanks was received from the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of Richmond and magistrates assembled at that
town, 'for the conduct of the detachment of the
regiment there when called upon to assist the
civil power, as well as for their excellent behaviour
since quartered in that town.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>On the 17th of December Colonel Lord Frederic
Fitz-Clarence, with a number of noblemen and
general officers from the Pavilion, saw the regiment;
and on the 27th of January, 1836, it was
inspected by His Serene Highness Prince Ernest
of Hesse Phillipstal, who was pleased to say to
Lieutenant-Colonel Chatterton&mdash;'I have heard
from every quarter the greatest praise of your
regiment, but what I have seen has surpassed
my utmost expectation, and I shall not fail to
mention to His Majesty the pleasure I have experienced
in seeing so fine a corps.' His Majesty
was afterwards pleased to express his royal satisfaction
at what Prince Ernest had reported; and
also his approbation, and that of the Queen, at the
excellent performance of the band at all times when
playing at the Pavilion; and at the good conduct
of the regiment during their Majesties' sojourn at
Brighton.</p>

<p>A change of quarters took place in May, and
the regiment was stationed at Dorchester, Trowbridge,
and Weymouth, and was inspected on the
11th and 12th of July by Major-General Sir
Charles Dalbiac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>During the following summer the regiment
marched for Manchester, and was stationed at
Hulme barracks; and on the 29th of May took
part in a grand procession and spectacle at Manchester
in honour of His Majesty's birth-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The decease of King William IV. having
taken place on the 20th of June, the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Dragoon Guards</span>, 48th regiment, and artillery,
took part in a grand procession on the 23rd of that
month, at Manchester, on the occasion of the proclamation
of the accession of <span class="smcap">Her Majesty Queen
Victoria</span> to the throne. On the following day
the regiment assumed the usual mourning for His
late Majesty.</p>

<p>In July the regiment marched out of Manchester,
during the election, and on two or three
occasions the troops were called upon to assist the
civil power at Salford, and also at Prescot; and on
the 26th of July a subaltern and 20 men marched
to Bury on a similar duty. On the 9th of August
the regiment returned to Hulme barracks, and
on the 10th and 11th was inspected by Major-General
Sir Charles Dalbiac.</p>

<p>After the termination of the elections the following
communication from Lord John Russell to
the general commanding-in-chief was communicated
to the regiment by Major-General Sir Richard
Jackson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'My Lord,</p>

<p>'I have received the Queen's commands to
signify to your Lordship Her Majesty's entire approval
of the conduct of the military employed
during the elections in England and Wales,
where their assistance has been called for by the
magistrates for the preservation of the public
peace; and to desire your Lordship will communicate
to the military, whose services have been
so required, Her Majesty's gracious approval of
their conduct.'</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 4th of October Major-General Sir
Richard Jackson, K.C.B., inspected the regiment.
In December detachments were employed in supporting
the civil power at Halifax and Bradford
against persons resisting the poor-laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>The regiment took part, with the royal artillery,
98th foot, and magistrates, clergy, &amp;c., in a
solemn procession in honour of Her Majesty's
birth-day at Manchester on the 17th of May.
During the following month it marched to the
vicinity of London, and was quartered at Islington
and Clerkenwell; and on the 28th of June two
squadrons occupied stations near Westminster
Abbey during the ceremonial of Her Majesty's
coronation.</p>

<p>On the 8th of July the regiment took the
Queen's Guard at the Horse Guards; and on the
following day furnished two squadrons to keep
the ground in Hyde Park during the time the
Household Cavalry Brigade, Tenth Royal Hussars,
Twelfth Royal Lancers, three troops of Royal
Horse Artillery, three batteries of Field Artillery,
four battalions of Foot Guards, and two battalions
of the Rifle Brigade, commanded by General the
Marquis of Anglesea, K.G. and G.C.B., were reviewed
by Her Majesty. A letter was afterwards
received from Lieutenant-General Sir Willoughby
Gordon, G.C.B., Quartermaster-General, expressive
of his 'perfect satisfaction at the very attentive
and soldierlike conduct of, and the great
assistance afforded by, the detachment of the regiment,
whilst keeping the ground in Hyde Park.'</p>

<p>After the review, the regiment marched to
Ipswich and Norwich, where it was inspected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Major-General Sir Charles Dalbiac, K.C.H., on
the 23rd of July: the regiment had not been stationed
in the county of Suffolk since the year 1688.</p>

<p>Her Majesty Queen Victoria was graciously
pleased to approve of this regiment bearing on
its standards and appointments the <em>Harp</em> and
<em>Crown</em>, in addition to the <em>Star</em> of the most illustrious
<em>Order of St. Patrick</em>, with the motto <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quis
separabit?</i> as a national badge connected with its
title of "<span class="smcap">Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span>."</p>

<p>On the 24th September a detachment of the
regiment marched from Norwich to Stanfield Hall,
where its presence was required to assist the civil
power in securing some persons who were illegally
assembled, and who bade defiance to the magistrates.
After some resistance the rioters were
secured, and eighty-four of them lodged in Norwich
Jail. The Magistrates transmitted to the
General Commanding in Chief a letter, explanatory
of the circumstances which had occasioned
them to call for the aid of the troops, and expressive
of their thanks for the promptitude with which
assistance was granted, as well as for the steadiness
and good conduct of the detachment, and for
the valuable aid afforded by the officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>The Fourth Dragoon Guards, under a well-regulated
system of discipline and the direction of
intelligent officers, in whom the men have confidence,
have evinced their usefulness to the country
by their firm and temperate conduct on home
duty, as well as by their bravery in the field when
called upon to combat a foreign enemy. Instances
frequently occur, in which the magistrates call for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the aid of the military, without whose co-operation
the civil police would sometimes be unequal to
repress and control the violence of a lawless mob.
On these occasions, the conduct of the troops has
been such as to draw forth the commendations and
thanks of the civil authorities, which have been
communicated to the General Commanding in
Chief, and by his authority signified in orders to
the troops who have been so employed, and whose
conduct has merited such commendations.</p>

Monmouth's regiment of horse, which was raised in 1678, in the
expectation of a war with France, and was disbanded in the following
year. In 1680 he raised an independent troop of horse for
service at Tangier in Africa, and proceeding thither immediately,
distinguished himself in an action with the Moors, on 27th of
September, 1680. In 1683 the four troops of Tangier horse were
constituted, together with two troops raised in England, the
Royal Regiment of Dragoons. Captain Nedby continued in the
Royal Dragoons until June, 1685, when he raised a troop of horse
for the Queen's Regiment, now 1st Dragoon Guards; and in

command of the Earl of Thanet, who was succeeded, on the 24th
of October of the same year, by Major-General Werden. This
officer commanded the regiment until December, 1688, when

to the Protestant interest. At the Revolution he was desirous
of having Ireland delivered into the hands of King William;
the Lord-Lieutenant, Earl Tyrconnel, appeared to acquiesce, and
sent Lord Mountjoy to France to obtain the sanction of King
James, who confined him in the Bastile, where he remained
until 1692, when he was exchanged for General Richard
Hamilton. He arrived from France a few days before the battle
of Steenkirk, and though holding no military rank, he served

on the Earl of Scarsdale, who was succeeded, on the 1st of December,
1687, by Charles, Duke of St. Alban's. This regiment
was remarkable for being one of the first corps which joined the
Prince of Orange in November, 1688; having been conducted to
His Highness's quarters by the Lieutenant-Colonel, Thomas
Langston, who was immediately promoted to the Colonelcy of the
regiment, and his brother, Captain Francis Langston, of the Royal
Dragoons, was promoted to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy. Colonel
Thomas Langston died of a fever at Lisburn, in Ireland, in December,
1689, and the Colonelcy of the regiment was conferred
on his brother Francis. This regiment served at the battles of
the Boyne and Aghrim in Ireland, and at Steenkirk in the Netherlands;
but having lost many men and horses, the remainder
were transferred to other corps, and the regiment was taken off

<hr class="r30" />
<p class="center smcap">James Earl of Arran.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 28th of July, 1685.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Earl of Arran</span> was the eldest son of Lord William
Douglas, a faithful supporter of the royal cause during
the rebellion, who was created Earl of Selkirk by King
Charles I. in 1646, and having married Anne Duchess of
Hamilton, only surviving daughter of James first Duke
of Hamilton, was, in consequence of a petition from the
Duchess, created <span class="smcap">Duke of Hamilton</span> for life by King
Charles II.</p>

<p>Shortly after the restoration the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran</span> obtained
an appointment in the household of King Charles
II.,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and after remaining some time at court, he was sent
with a congratulatory communication to the French Monarch,
and served two campaigns with the French army
in the capacity of aide-de-camp to Louis XIV. In 1685,
when the Earl of Argyle raised the standard of rebellion
in Scotland, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran</span> took an active part
against the insurgents: he also raised a troop of horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>for the service of King James II., who appointed him
Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Sixth Regiment of Horse</span>, now <span class="smcap">Fourth,
or Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</span>. He was nominated
a Knight Companion of the Thistle, on the revival of
that Order in 1687, and in the following year he was
promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General, and appointed
Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards. At
the Revolution his conduct was remarkable for the unshaken
fidelity which he evinced to his sovereign under
all circumstances. When he could no longer serve the
King in a military capacity, he performed his duty as
gentleman of the bed-chamber, and attended His Majesty
from the time of his departure from London to the moment
of his embarkation at Rochester; and at the meeting
of the Scottish nobility and gentry in London, in
January, 1689, at which the duke, his father, presided,
he expressed himself in reply to the request of the Prince
of Orange for advice:&mdash;'The surest way to heal the
breach is to address His Majesty to return from France,
and call a free parliament. I can distinguish between
his popery and his person: I dislike the one; but I
have sworn, and do owe, allegiance to the other.' He
had previously been removed from his regiment by the
Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>During the hostilities which followed the accession of
William and Mary, the <span class="smcap">Earl of Arran</span> did not appear
in arms in favour of King James; but he was suspected
of corresponding with the court of France, and was twice
committed a prisoner to the Tower of London: he was,
however, discharged without being brought to trial. After
the decease of his father the dukedom of Hamilton reverted
to his mother, in whom it was hereditary; but
she resigned that honour in favour of his lordship, who
was created <span class="smcap">Duke of Hamilton</span>, by patent, dated the
10th of August, 1698. His grace adhered, privately,
to the interest of King James and the Pretender, until
his decease, which was tragical, being killed in a duel
with Lord Mohun, who was also slain at the same time
in Hyde Park, on the 15th of November, 1712.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Charles Earl of Selkirk.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 20th November, 1688.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Lord Charles Hamilton</span>, third son of William Duke
of Hamilton, entered the Life Guards in the year 1686,
and obtained the appointment of Guidon and Major in
the fourth troop. He was advanced to the peerage by
the title of <span class="smcap">Earl of Selkirk</span>, on his father's resignation
of that honour, in October, 1688; and adhering to King
James II. at the Revolution, was promoted to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Sixth Horse</span>, in succession to his brother the
Earl of Arran; but was removed from his regiment by
the Prince of Orange, in December of the same year.
The <span class="smcap">Earl of Selkirk</span> subsequently entered warmly
into the protestant interest, and held civil appointments
under the crown in the reigns of William III., George I.,
and George II.; and died on the 13th of March, 1739.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Charles Godfrey.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 31st December, 1688.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">When the army was augmented in 1678, in the expectation
of a war with France, <span class="smcap">Charles Godfrey</span>, Esq.,
obtained a commission in the Duke of Monmouth's Regiment
of Horse, which was disbanded in the following
year. He appears not to have held any military appointment
from that period until the revolution in 1688,
when, being a strenuous advocate of the protestant cause,
he obtained, through the interest of John Lord Churchill,
the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Sixth Horse</span>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> After the Earl of
Marlborough had been sent prisoner to the Tower of
London, on a charge of treason, Colonel Godfrey was
removed from his command; and he did not afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>serve in a military capacity. He was many years Master
of the Jewel House, and a Member of Parliament in the
reign of Queen Anne; and died in 1715.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Francis Langston.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 7th March, 1693.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This officer served under his brother, Captain Thomas
Langston, who commanded a troop of horse at Tangier
in Africa, and signalized himself against the Moors.
When the troops of Tangier Horse were constituted
Royal Dragoons, in 1683, <span class="smcap">Francis Langston</span> obtained
a commission in that corps, and he served in the Royal
Regiment of Dragoons until December, 1688, when
the Prince of Orange promoted him to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy
of the Eighth, or Princess Anne's Regiment
of Horse, of which his brother was appointed Colonel.
He proceeded with his regiment to Ireland in the same
year; and his brother Thomas dying in that country, he
was appointed to succeed him in the Colonelcy of the
Eighth Horse. He served at the head of his regiment at
the battles of the Boyne and Aghrim, and in numerous
skirmishes, until the final reduction of Ireland under the
dominion of William III. His services were immediately
afterwards transferred to the Netherlands; and his regiment
having suffered severely, from having been long
exposed to a furious cannonade at the battle of Steenkirk,
it was disbanded, and Colonel Langston was appointed
to the command of the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>, now <span class="smcap">Fourth
Dragoon Guards</span>. At the battle of <em>Landen</em> this officer
highly distinguished himself at the head of the right
squadron of his regiment, and was wounded and taken
prisoner. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General
on the 1st of June, 1697; and proceeding, after
the peace of Ryswick, with his regiment to Ireland, he
was placed on the staff of the army in that country.</p>

<p>During the wars in the reign of Queen Anne this officer
was not employed on foreign service, but was continued
on the staff of Ireland. He was promoted to the rank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Major-General on the 1st of June, 1703, and to that of
Lieutenant-General on the 1st of June, 1704.</p>

<p>When the great Duke of Marlborough was removed
from his military commands, Lieutenant-General Langston
appears to have been considered too firmly devoted
to the protestant cause, and to the succession of the House
of Hanover, for the new ministry to confide in him, and
he retired from the army. This veteran died on the 6th
of April, 1723.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">George Jocelyn.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 20th October, 1713.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">This officer obtained the commission of Cornet in <em>the
Queen Dowager's</em> Regiment of Horse, commanded by
George Viscount Hewyt (now Sixth Dragoon Guards)
in 1689, and served at the battle of the Boyne under
King William III. On the 5th of May, 1690, he was
engaged in a gallant affair with the enemy near Castle
Cuff, and was wounded.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He also served at the battle
of Aghrim, and siege of Limerick; and in 1693 at the
hard-contested battle of Landen. After the peace of
Ryswick he entered the corps of Life Guards, and rose to
the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Second Troop (now
Second Regiment), commanded by the Duke of Ormond.
On the 29th of May, 1706, he obtained the rank of Colonel
in the army, and on the 12th of February, 1711, that
of Brigadier-General. After the Duke of Ormond was
promoted to the elevated station of Captain-General
of the Forces, Brigadier-General Jocelyn obtained the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>; and when his Grace
was removed from the command of the army by King
George I., this officer obtained permission to dispose of his
appointment: he died on the 9th of November, 1727.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sherrington Davenport</span> was appointed Adjutant of
the Queen Dowager's Regiment of Horse in 1687; and
after serving at the battles of the Boyne and Aghrim,
and at both sieges of Limerick, in Ireland; and at the
battle of Landen, and covering the siege of Namur in the
Netherlands, he was promoted to the Majority of the
regiment on the 13th of August, 1696. He subsequently
obtained a commission in the First Troop (now First
Regiment) of Life Guards, in which corps he obtained
the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was appointed
Brigadier-General in 1707, and Major-General in 1710;
and being firmly devoted to the protestant interest, he
was permitted, soon after the arrival of King George I.
from Hanover, to purchase the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fifth
Horse</span>, which he retained until his decease on the 2nd
of July, 1719.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Owen Wynne.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 6th July, 1719.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Owen Wynne</span> entered the army on the 8th of March,
1688. After the Revolution he proceeded to Ireland, of
which country he was a native, and he was engaged with
the Enniskillen men in their determined resistance to the
power of King James II. When the Enniskillen bands
were incorporated into regiments, he obtained a commission
in Wynne's (afterwards Fifth or Royal Irish) Dragoons.
With this corps he served in numerous skirmishes
and engagements until after the reduction of the whole of
Ireland under the power of King William III. He also
served under the King in Flanders, and was appointed
Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment on the 20th of July,
1695. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel in 1703,
and was commissioned, in 1705, to raise and discipline a
regiment of foot, of which he was appointed Colonel. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
1706 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General,
and on the 1st of January, 1709, to that of Major-General.
His regiment of foot served the campaigns of 1710 and
1711 under the great Duke of Marlborough, and that of
1712 under the Duke of Ormond, and was disbanded
after the conclusion of the peace of Utrecht; but in 1715,
when Jacobite principles had become so prevalent in the
nation that an insurrection was expected, a regiment of
dragoons (now the Ninth Lancers) was raised, of which
Major-General Owen Wynne was appointed Colonel;
and he was instrumental in suppressing the rebellion
which broke out in the autumn of that year in favour of
the Pretender. In 1719 he was removed to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>; and on the 10th of March,
1726, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General.
He was removed to the Colonelcy of the Royal Irish
Dragoons, in which corps he had performed his early
services, in August, 1732; and he held the command of
that regiment until his decease on the 28th of February,
1737.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Thomas Pearce.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 27th September, 1732.</em></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Thomas Pearce</span>, choosing the profession of arms, obtained
the commission of Ensign on the 28th of February,
1689, and after serving three campaigns in the Netherlands,
he was appointed Captain of the Grenadier company
in the Second Foot Guards in October, 1694. In
the following summer he served at the siege of Namur,
and was engaged on the night of the 8th of July in storming
the covered way, when, led by his innate ardour, he
advanced too far in front of his men, and was wounded
and taken prisoner. He served in the expedition to Cadiz
in 1702, and commanded the first division of Grenadiers,
which effected a landing between Rota and Fort St. Catherine.
Himself and eight men only had landed, when
they were charged by a troop of Spanish horse. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
grenadiers fought manfully, slew the Spanish commanding
officer and five men, took two officers prisoners, and
forced the remainder to retreat: he afterwards summoned
the Fort of St. Catherine, which surrendered: he also
commanded a party of grenadiers at the storming of the
Forts of Vigo, and was wounded. His gallantry was
rewarded, in April of the following year, with the Colonelcy
of a newly-raised regiment of foot, from which he
was removed in February, 1704, to an older corps&mdash;now
the Fifth or Northumberland Fusiliers. In 1707, he
proceeded with his regiment to Portugal; and in 1709
highly distinguished himself at the head of a brigade of
infantry at the battle of the Caya, where he was taken
prisoner. After being exchanged he was promoted to the
rank of Major-General, and returning to Portugal, commanded
a brigade in that country until the peace of
Utrecht. On the 5th of March, 1727, he was promoted
to the rank of Lieutenant-General, and in 1732 he was
removed to the <span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>. He was a member of
Parliament for Melcombe Regis, and died in 1739.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="smcap">Hon. James O'Hara</span> was appointed Lieutenant in
the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, commanded by his
father, on the 15th of March, 1703; and in 1706 he proceeded
with his regiment to the relief of Barcelona. In
the following year he served on the staff of the army in
Spain, and was wounded at the battle of Almanza, where,
it is said, he was instrumental in saving the Earl of Galway's
life. He served several years at Minorca; and in
1713 obtained the Colonelcy of the Royal Fusiliers, in
succession to his father, at whose decease, in 1733, he
succeeded to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Baron Tyrawley</span>. The
rank of Brigadier-General was conferred on his lordship
on the 23rd of November, 1735; that of Major-General
on the 2nd of July, 1739; and in August of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
year, he was removed from the Royal Fusiliers to the
<span class="smcap">Fifth Horse</span>. In March, 1743, he was promoted to
the rank of Lieutenant-General; and in the following
month obtained the Colonelcy of the Second Troop of
Horse Grenadier Guards, from which he was removed,
in 1745, to the Third Troop of Life Guards, which gave
him the privilege of taking the court duty of gold stick.
In 1746, when King George II. had resolved to disband
the Third and Fourth Troops of Life Guards, his lordship
was removed to the Tenth Foot; he was again removed,
in 1749, to the Fourteenth Dragoons; in 1752,
to the Third Dragoons; and in 1755, to the Second, or
Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards. He was appointed
Governor of Portsmouth on the 1st of May, 1759,
and was promoted to the rank of General on the 7th of
March, 1761. He held the appointment of Governor of
Minorca for several years; was employed as Envoy and
Ambassador to the courts of Portugal and Russia; and
died at Twickenham on the 13th of July, 1773.</p>

<p class="noindent">This officer entered the army as Cornet of horse on
the 5th of August, 1704, and served several campaigns
on the continent in the army commanded by John Duke
of Marlborough. In 1735 he was Lieutenant-Colonel of
the Fourth Dragoons, from whence he was removed to
the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the King's Horse (now First
Dragoon Guards); and on the 10th of May, 1742, he

Thirteenth Dragoons on the 5th of October, 1736, and
was removed to the Royal Dragoons in 1739, in which
corps he rose to the rank of Major, and was promoted to
the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the Thirteenth Dragoons on

under Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick. He particularly
distinguished himself at the battle of Warbourg, and

promoted to the local rank of Major-General in Germany;
and he commanded a brigade of cavalry during the cam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>paign

sterner military virtues,&mdash;for a gentlemanly deportment,&mdash;and
an amiable disposition, which procured him the

Dragoons, at the head of which corps he served many
years, and brought it into so high a state of discipline,
that, whenever King George III. reviewed the corps, he
expressed his approbation of its excellent condition in the
strongest terms. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel

his regiment,&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Fourth Royal Irish Dragoon
Guards</span>,&mdash;into a most perfect condition for active service.
He possessed the soundest ideas of what cavalry ought to
be; he had an aversion to slow movements, and although
nearly seventy years of age, he exercised his regiment
five times a week,&mdash;often leading it across the country
over hedge and ditch, to the astonishment of every one.
He was promoted to the rank of General in 1796, and
died on the 11th of March, 1803. He was celebrated
for philanthropy, and was represented by historians as a
man 'of inviolable, disinterested integrity, public and
private; and the bestower of benefactions scarcely less
secret than extensive.'</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
